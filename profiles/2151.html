			<b>Brief Profile:</b><br/>
			This page is solely meant to help future applicants. <br/><br/><B>I found that looking at mdapplicant profile pages who were accepted to medical school helped guide me somewhat. I hope future students use my profile like I used others'.  If you feel like this helped you, maybe you should do the same for future applicants. As time moves on, this page will become more and more outdated since the AMCAS application constantly changes. <U>Help future applicants by keeping your mdapps detailed.</U></B><br/><br/>Now that the cycle is over for me, I have added my personal statement and activities. They are copy and pasted from my AMCAS application, any grammatical errors and typos found were left there. The only thing removed are names. At the bottom of the page, you will find three update letters I sent to UWSOM that spanned five-ish months. <br/><br/>In addition, I applied to so many schools because I didn't receive my MCAT score (32R) until July 24th and applied before that date. I didn't know if my score would improve past the 28Q and I only wanted to apply once. Hence the absurdly long (IMO) list of schools.<br/><br/>Some people have asked me why I didn't attend all the interviews and only went to three out of the eight I received. Frankly put, I didn't have the money to pay to live, attend interviews, save up for moving and pay for a wedding. I attended the first three interviews I received and had Creighton accept me on the first day I could be accepted. At that point, I did not schedule additional interviews because I knew I would be happy wherever I ended up (Creighton, or if I was accepted to UW or VCU) and was going to be a doctor. In January I was told I received a scholarship to Creighton that would make tuition cheaper than the other medical schools and that further encouraged me to not attend the other interviews.<br/><br/><h1>Quick facts:</h1><p>Previous MCAT, 8VR, 10BS, 10PS (28Q)<br/>Dual degree student, B.A. Foreign Language and Culture (Spanish degree)/B.S.

We are investigating what is the best way to eliminate E. coli from apples that have been contaminated in the harvest process. Since there is no standard for the cleaning process of apples we are investigating which is the best. I wanted to help because eliminating a potential source of E. coli will reduce the chance of outbreaks and preventative measure taken now will prevent future deaths and infections.

I volunteered in the ER for 108 hours and the birthplace for 24 hours, for a total of 132 hours. My main job in the ER started out as just changing linen after the patient left but I soon began to record vital signs, restock rooms, help clean wounds, and to observe the doctors and nurses when the opportunity arose. Other duties included checking on patients and talking to them during the course of their stay. Towards the end of my experience, doctors allowed me to follow them, look at charts and see x-rays, as well as ask questions about treatment options. <br/><br/>Most Meaningful<br/><br/> At Pullman Regional Hospital, I originally volunteered in the birthplace. I would check on patients, ask if I could bring them anything and restock the supplies in the rooms. After doing this for a few months, I chose to explore different areas of the hospital. On my first day in the ER, however, I decided that I would spend a majority of my volunteer hours there because I could interact with patients much more frequently. In addition, the doctors and nurses in the ER were extremely helpful and insightful. In my free time, I could ask them about their professions and daily experiences and I found myself more attracted to medicine. I liked the quick pace and knowledge level required to be an efficient doctor, and I believed that I had the skills to be that. I loved talking with doctors, looking at x-rays, urine and blood tests and then applying my knowledge from classes to help diagnose the patients. I found that I interacted well with patients, giving them confidence and alleviating worries. Patients would often tell me that I helped them calm down, which is essential in the interaction between doctors and patients, but especially in an emergency room. My time at PRH caused me to investigate more into other fields of medicine, which I may not have explored without first volunteering there. </div> </div><div class="paul411activity"> <a class="paul411activitytitle arrow" onclick="event.srcElement.nextSibling.toggle();event.srcElement.toggleClassName('expanded');event.srcElement.nextSibling.toggleClassName('paul411visible')" href="javascript:void(0)">Intern at Subcentro de Salud Ficoa de Montalvo</a><div style="display:none" class="paul411activitydescription">Summer 2011<br/> I was selected to intern at the Subcentro de Salud FIcoa de Montalvo because of my pre-med and Spanish classes as part of my study abroad experience. The clinic is located in a poor neighborhood in Guayaquil, Ecuador. I was involved both in and out of the clinic four days a week for four hours each day. In the clinic, I primarily took and recorded height, weight and blood pressure of the patients. Outside of the clinic, I would go to local schools and do the same activities and conduct vision tests, give vaccinations, and ask the children about their home life and body development. All interactions were conducted in Spanish due to the location. I worked there a total of 120 hours. </div> </div><div class="paul411activity"> <a class="paul411activitytitle arrow" onclick="event.srcElement.nextSibling.toggle();event.srcElement.toggleClassName('expanded');event.srcElement.nextSibling.toggleClassName('paul411visible')" href="javascript:void(0)">*Hearts in Motion*</a><div style="display:none" class="paul411activitydescription">Spring Break 2012<br/>I went to Guatemala for ten days during Spring break of 2012. I was selected to participate due to my Spanish speaking abilities and pre-med classes. I was directly involved with helping the patients and conducting medical consultations, which included translating for about 150 different patients for the doctors and PAs that did not speak Spanish. I translated directions for medications to patients in the recovery room. We worked to help improve the lives of the people while we are there by repairing cleft lips/palates, going to various locations in Guatemala to provide medicine and health services to under-served people, and to help build an addition to the Hearts in Motion eyeglass clinic. <br/><br/>Most Meaningful<br/><br/>My short time with Hearts in Motion (HIM) was the accumulation of my four years of Spanish studying. On the first day of the trip I was selected to go to the hospital to translate for the surgeons. What I thought would be a good day actually turned out to be one of the most difficult. Every year, HIM sends maxillofacial surgeons to Zacapa to fix cleft lips/palates, but this year there was a deadly flu passing through the region. I had to turn people away until next year, which was extremely difficult to do until I realized that we were protecting them since an infection could kill the patient. The following three days I was selected to work hand-in-hand with a doctor or a physician's assistant in a traveling clinic. As the patients told the doctor their problem, I was the person that translated the dialog so that each person understood what the other wanted to say. While I had some trouble with dialog at first, by the end of the trip I was able to anticipate what questions the doctors would ask and have the answer ready for them. I was able to use all the Spanish that I had learned and translated for over 150 patients. The gratification of giving the patient something as simple as vitamins was rewarding. The doctors admitted that the trip would not have been possible without the student translators.</div></div><div class="paul411activity"> <a class="paul411activitytitle arrow" onclick="event.srcElement.nextSibling.toggle();event.srcElement.toggleClassName('expanded');event.srcElement.nextSibling.toggleClassName('paul411visible')" href="javascript:void(0)">Shadowing - Cardiologist</a><div style="display:none" class="paul411activitydescription">Spring Break 2011<br/> I shadowed a cardiologist named Dr. X over Spring break 2011 for 40 hours. During the shadow experience, I was taught how to read EKGs, nuclear stress tests, and the basis for how to talk to patients. He allowed me to read the tests and offer my diagnosis, which he then compared with his own. We spent most of shadow experience in the clinic, doing routine checkups of the patients.

My favorite part of following Dr. X was that he would always take time to explain to me how and why he was doing everything that he did. For example, I learned that for young children, a doctor can judge many of their developmental qualities by observing the kids play while also talking to the parent. Dr. X would often allow me to look at labs and discuss possible diseases/treatments. When I had questions regarding a possible test or medicine, Dr. X would answer all questions that I had.

Aquscaping is the process of selecting, growing and maintaining plants in an aquarium in an artistic way. Currently I have two fully aquascaped aquariums. As I progressed in the hobby, I soon started to have too many plants for my own tank. I gave away plants to my friends but they soon did not have room for my excess. In June 2010, I started an ebay business where I sell the excess plants. I primarily grow Riccia fluitans to sell but I am working to expand my selection of plants that I can sell.

After reading an article in the New York Times that said immigrants avoid hospital visits since they cannot communicate effectively with doctors, I decided to learn Spanish. Since then, I studied abroad in Guayaquil, Ecuador during the summer of 2011 where I took classes at the Universidad de Especialidades Esp�ritu Santo. I traveled abroad for Spring break to Guatemala to participate in Hearts in Motion, a medical relief trip that specializes in medical/dental clinics and cleft lip/palate repair surgeries. While I am not fluent, I am proficient and have the basis for communicating with patients. I continually work towards improving.<br/><br/>Most Meaningful<br/><br/>had made the decision to not learn a foreign language after I had satisfied my graduation requirements in high school. However, the article in the New York Times caused me to take a new foreign language in college; Spanish. I originally thought learning Spanish would be simple, so I registered myself in my first Spanish course. While it did not end up being easy, I believe learning Spanish is one of the best decisions I have made. My life would be very different today if I had not attempted to learn a second language. Many of my activities, such as participating in Hearts in Motion or doing the internship at the Subcentro de Salud, have been a result of my determination to learn and trying to communicate better. I want to practice medicine in the United States, and my speaking Spanish will allow me to speak to many patients in under-served locations. My classes have also caused me to be more focused, looking for ways to learn outside of the classroom along with taking more credits than a normal undergraduate would take. Rather than receive one degree at the end of college, my Spanish classes led me to try to earn two in about the same amount of time. This determination to learn Spanish has also positively affected and reinforced my other classes since many of my activities abroad relate. </div> </div><br/><div class="paul411activitysection"><h3>Employment</h3><div class="paul411activity"> <a class="paul411activitytitle arrow" onclick="event.srcElement.nextSibling.toggle();event.srcElement.toggleClassName('expanded');event.srcElement.nextSibling.toggleClassName('paul411visible')" href="javascript:void(0)">AmeriCorps</a><div style="display:none" class="paul411activitydescription">Summer 2009, Summer 2010<br/>I helped maintain and build surface and storm water retention facilities.

We could not have looked more different. She being an Ecuadorian schoolgirl, so small from lack of food and yet pure in her white school dress and wearing her new glasses while I stood beside her, a stark contrast; tall, white, blonde hair and blue eyes. The rest of the school persisted in a calm chaos. She did not have much to say, only one word, "Gracias." I did not need to hear the word; her face had already told me before she had the chance. I could not spend more time with her because I had to continue to test the vision of the children at her school. If I had any regret, it was that I never learned her name, but I will never forget her face.<br/><p>My original goal was to be a doctor and I immediately decided to major in Zoology at Washington State University. I enrolled in mostly science classes, but I decided to take a Spanish course as I was registering. I intended to take a few courses, just enough to understand basic words patients said. However, four years later, I am graduating with a B.S. in Zoology and a B.A. in Spanish from WSU. My choice to get a B.A. in Spanish did not happen until recently, following a series of events that took me from North to South America, meeting people like the girl above and many others along the way. These experiences have solidified my original decision to become a doctor.<br/><p>During my spring sophomore semester, I began to volunteer in the Pullman Regional Hospital, and I found myself attracted to the ER. There, I went from room to room to record vitals of the patients and talk to them, conferring with doctors about treatments and medicines. A single patient, however, influenced me more than any patient before. An immigrant came and after attempts at contacting an interpreter failed, I hesitantly stated that I spoke Spanish though I had never spoken Spanish outside the classroom. The patient had concerns about a wound and the interpreter called after I translated the initial worries. While I saw the demand of Spanish speaking doctors, through a self-critical analysis, I discovered that I lacked many words in my Spanish vocabulary to communicate effectively. My initial goal of being able to understand a few words was not sufficient and I knew I had a weakness that I could correct. My motivation and ambition to speak Spanish lead me to study abroad in Ecuador during the summer of 2011 to participate in a medical Spanish program.<br/><p>My time in Ecuador was busy since I had two jobs; I was both a student at university and a volunteer at a clinic in one of the poorest neighborhoods in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Every day had a schedule that required versatility; I went to my internship for four hours, had classes for another four and a few hours of commuting in between. My enthusiasm for helping people like the little Ecuadorian schoolgirl encouraged me to continue and thrive. My main jobs in the clinic were to go to local schools to give immunizations, take vitals and conduct general health screenings and vision tests of the students. After a month, I began to speak to patients more openly. By the second month I was proficient in Spanish. The doctors allowed me to help teach the children about brushing their teeth and eating a balanced diet. Rather than treat symptoms, we taught basic preventative medicine to fix the problem. The little changes and help we provided can forever change lives, and I am eager to be a part of that. Soon after returning from Ecuador, I saw the short-term benefits of becoming a doctor.<br/><p>The medical mission trip called Hearts in Motion was a ten day trip to Guatemala in which doctors go abroad to repair cleft lip and palate. I was selected to participate because of my passion for medicine and the ability to speak Spanish. My favorite part was the health clinic where I was responsible for translating the dialog between the physician and the patient. During my short stay, I translated for over 150 patients. I recall one patient vividly. A grandmother approached me in the dental clinic with black stubs as teeth. She could barely speak because of the pain, but she asked if we could remove all of her teeth. Worried about not understanding correctly, I decided to seek a second opinion on the translation. I went to my professor and asked her to double check, which she verified I correctly translated. As each tooth was extracted, I held the grandmother's hand, reassuring her that everything was going well. After all fourteen teeth were removed, the grandmother smiled with her stitched gums and said the same one word the small, Ecuadorian girl said, "Gracias." Being able to speak a patient's maternal language has a soothing effect, and I desire to bring this to medicine. After translating during the trip, I shocked myself with how I could communicate effectively with patients.<br/><p>My background has allowed me to see the healthcare setting from many different aspects. With my passion to help, self-motivation to learn and tenacity, I believe I have a lot to offer the medical profession. My unique quality, however, is my ambition and experiences in both North and South America, which showed me how much I can do. My most rewarding and meaningful experiences have involved serving others, and I hope to continue this work as a physician. </div></div><br/><br/><h1>MCAT Information</h1><div class="paul411activitysection" id="paul411"></div><br/><p>Take the MCAT seriously. I didn't the first time I took it. I only planned three weeks of study time and then took the test. I left the day after my MCAT to study abroad. This was a huge mistake and one thing that I regretted ever doing. <br/><br/>The second time I took the MCAT, I planned out a solid two month study plan. Again, this may be short, but I knew I could study hard and get higher than my first MCAT of a 28. The first month was intense review. I read and reread the Princeton Review MCAT book multiple times. I did practice problems from EK and practiced verbal by reading magazines and practice passages from EK 101. <br/><br/>During the second month, I did practice tests and focused on my weak areas. About two weeks before the test, I was burned out and quit studying. I did a few practice problems and just casually read the book. I was consistently scoring above a 30 with 10s in all sections so I quit trying to raise the score and just focused on maintaining it. I wish I hadn't of done this because I could have scored in the high 30s on the real thing and gotten into medical schools much easier. Alas, I didn't and there is nothing I can do to change it. Please don't make this mistake.<br/><br/>AAMC #4 = 32 (11 P, 9 VR, 12 BS)<br/>AAMC #5 = 33 (11 P, 10 VR, 12 BS)<br/>AAMC #7 = 30 (11 P, 9 VR, 10 BS)<br/>AAMC #8 = 35 (12 P, 10 VR, 13 BS)<br/>Actual MCAT = 32 (11 P, 10 VR, 11 BS)<br/><br/><div class="paul411activitysection"><h1>Personal Notes</h1><div class="paul411activity"> <a class="paul411activitytitle arrow" onclick="event.srcElement.nextSibling.toggle();event.srcElement.toggleClassName('expanded');event.srcElement.nextSibling.toggleClassName('paul411visible')" href="javascript:void(0)">Click to read.</a><div style="display:none" class="paul411activitydescription"><p>Looking back at the process, I would do some things differently. I didn't research each school enough. I applied to Howard, a historically URM school, despite being a white male. I didn't know that when I first applied, that's why I never submitted the secondary. I also applied to NEOMED, which is mostly a BS/MD school. Again, I didn't know this. I applied because of the mission statement and their average MCAT score was lower. It was going to be a safety school, but I didn't have a chance there because a lot of their class is made up of BS/MD students.<br/><br/>What did I think I did well? Personally, I like some of my personal statement. It could have flowed better, but I feel like having a repetitive word that is foreign (Gracias) linked the beginning and the end together. It caused the reader to remember it. I also made the end a big strong conclusion, kind of like a call to action to give me an interview. Looking back I would make that more of a middle of the essay and the focal point. <br/><br/>I also tried to make my 15 experiences tell more of a story for me. I feel like I did that well. I really do have a desire to work with the underserved hispanic community and I wanted to make that a point of my application. I think it worked since I got 8 interviews, but I would only do this if you really wanted to work with the underserved like this.<br/><br/>If you have any questions, feel free to send me a message here or on SDN. </div></div></div>		</p>

					<p>First interview invite! So excited! I thought I did something wrong since no schools had contacted me yet, even though it is the beginning of August!<br/>The interview went great. I love the campus and the area. Hopefully I get an acceptance, but I have to wait over a month to hear back.<br/><br/>Accepted!!! I am so excited! First medical school acceptance. It isn't my top choice, but at least I have a place to go. I am going to be a doctor!  Accepted on the first day an acceptance could go out, so I feel pretty lucky.<br/><br/>2/8/2013 - Just got an email saying I got a scholarship! $25,000 per year. That's almost half of tuition! However, that made making a decision about which school to attend much more difficult. </p>

					<b>Summary of Experience:</b>
					<p>Matriculating!  <br/><br/>Second school to send me an interview invitation! Wow! My feelings about this cycle have changed dramatically and it has only been a few days!<br/><br/>After interview: Wow, the school is amazing and I felt like I could see myself attending there. Since I am from the area originally, looking out the window at Lake Washington really brought me back. I felt like I was at home.<br/><br/>Update, 11/1/12: Put in the under consideration group. Lame.<br/><br/>Update, 11/27/12: Still under consideration. School attached my update letter to my application one day after EXCOM meeting so they will look at it at the next one. <br/><br/>Update, 12/14/12: Still under consideration for the third time. <br/><br/>Update, 1/9/13: Still under consideration (forth time), but school has received second update letter. This one includes my graduation with two degrees, recent jobs, new TA positions for anatomy (3 labs) and comparative anatomy (2 labs). Hopefully this one leads to some love. No EXCOM meeting has happened yet (since I haven't received an email saying so) so they will see the letters during the next one that may happen in a few days. I am nervous about this school. I would love to go here and it is my dream school. Luckily I already have two acceptances and I could see myself going to either one if UW doesn't work out.<br/><br/>Update, 1/18/13: Additional LOR specific to UWSOM, from the Lab Manager of the WSU anatomy lab and WWAMI Pullman anatomy lab, received and added to file. Just have to wait for the next EXCOM meeting to find out if this is enough. I thought I was fairly competitive to UW because I fit with their mission statement, am an in-state applicant, have decent scores and had an okay (not amazing but not terrible) interview. Hopefully something changes soon. As much as I am excited to start school at one of the other medical schools, I don't really have the money lined up to get married and move across the country. <br/><br/>Update, 2/15/13: They still have not voted since receiving the additional LOR. However, I have written my final update letter for them and it includes notification of the scholarship offer from Creighton and acceptance to VCU. Basically it says I will turn down these offers if given the ability to attend UWSOM.Also included is more shadowing hours, new job title and my biggest likes of UW that are unique from other medical schools. I state that I am either hoping for an acceptance or a higher spot on the waitlist. I will not send it until after hearing back if I am still under consideration after the February vote.  From their website, I should be notified prior to March. Then they will do the final round of acceptance/create the waitlist in mid-March. Therefor, I will probably submit this letter in beginning of March if needed so it will be in there during the final EXCOM review. Hopefully I will not need to send it.<br/><br/>Update, 2/27/13: Got a SUC email. It seems like nobody from WA got in this last vote, so there is still hope. <br/><br/>Update, 3/3/13: I previously wrote that I had written a final update letter for UW. I editted it on the 2nd, but decided to wait until today to send it so I could include what I have done with my fiancee's class. Hopefully I get in, but I won't be crushed if I don't. I mean, it will hurt since I have worked hard to go to UW. However, having two acceptances means I will be a doctor no matter where I go. Let's just hope the school I attend is UW.<br/><br/>Update, 3/19/2013: Accepted! Top choice and will withdraw from my other acceptances once I get the update on my application online. I am so excited! I don't know where I will be spending the first year, but my fiancee and I are pushing for Seattle so she can get a teaching job easier. In fact, she is going to a teacher fair tomorrow in Seattle to get a job.</p>

			<h2 style="padding-top: 15px;">Summary of Application Experience</h2>

			<p>Will matriculate at University of Washington School of Medicine.<br/><br/>These are all the updates I sent to UW.<br/><br/>Interviewed early October<br/><br/><h2>Update 1:</h2><br/>Sent late November by mail.<br/><br/>Dear Executive Committee,<br/><br/>	With the first round of acceptances being given out, and upon being put on the �Under Consideration� status, I wanted to write this letter stating my specific interest in being considered for acceptance at University of Washington School of Medicine in the fall of 2013.<br/><br/>	From the moment I arrived in Seattle, I knew I wanted to stay in Washington and return to the Puget Sound area. I cannot express the feelings I felt at lunch, being able to look out the window at Lake Washington and seeing the trees, sky and water together. At first it was overwhelming, but I soon discovered that I missed the region. Truth be told, I felt like I was home. Being at University of Washington School of Medicine will make me happy in a way that other schools will not. In addition to liking the area, my support group is already established in the region, allowing me to be a more focused student.<br/><br/>	In addition to the surroundings, I was amazed by the facilities at UW Seattle and unique opportunities for third and fourth year clerkship sites around the WWAMI region. Regional sites are a huge benefit and I would love to be placed in sites that have a larger Hispanic population so I could fine-tune my Spanish speaking skills. Even if I was not selected to do a clerkship in one of these sites, the advantage of having interactions with physicians and patients in other locations is enormous. <br/><br/>	I am also writing to notify the school that my fianc�e accepted grants for her Master�s in Teaching that requires her to teach in underprivileged regions. The reason why I am stating this is that both she and I studied Spanish at Washington State University and her goal is to teach at the underserved Hispanic schools in Washington, the same locations that I would eventually like to practice primary care medicine. This reinforces that I will work for the underserved Latino population in disadvantaged areas.<br/><br/>	Finally, I would like to keep you updated on my recent activities. Due to the financial aid debacle at Washington State University, I have had to work three jobs to finance my education and application process for medical school. I currently work two teaching assistant jobs and an undergraduate research technician job. I am writing to notify UWSOM that I will be continuing one of the TA jobs the following semester, hopefully teaching three of the anatomy cadaver labs, and continuing my work in the X Lab. I am also in the process of applying for other full time jobs, so hopefully I will be working full time in January. I am currently finishing up the last of my classes and will graduate in December with a B.A. in Foreign Languages and Culture and a B.S. in Zoology, two degrees that will help me tremendously as a medical student and physician.<br/><br/>	I am confident that I will make an outstanding addition to the incoming class of 2017.  I believe that my background, experiences with the Hispanic population, passion for preventative medicine and academic achievement will make University of Washington School of Medicine a perfect match to my medical education. The ability to do clerkships at smaller hospitals and the culture of the student population highlights that UWSOM will make me the physician that I have always dreamed of being. I hope this new information is taken into account during the next EXCOM meeting when you vote on my application.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration,<br/>BABSstudent<br/><br/><br/><h2>Update 2:</h2><br/>Sent early January by email.<br/><br/>Dear EXCOM members,<br/><br/>	Upon completion of my education at Washington State University, and still being �Under Consideration,� I wrote this letter to update my application for University of Washington School of Medicine for acceptance in the class of 2017. I believe I will be a valuable contribution to the class and that my recent graduation, teaching jobs, research and volunteer work should be added to my application for consideration at the next EXCOM meeting. <br/><br/>	I recently finished my college education, completing two degrees in four and a half years. While this has been difficult to do, I graduated with the class of 2012 in December with a B.S. in Zoology and B.A. in Foreign Languages and Cultures. I wish to update my application by stating that I am now advanced in my Spanish speaking abilities. I had been on the verge of becoming advanced, and this last semester of grammar courses and earning an A in it has helped me fix some minor errors in my speaking abilities. While my Spanish is still not perfect, being a University of Washington medical student will benefit me because of the regional sites with a larger Hispanic population. This is the population that I hope to eventually serve. <br/><br/>	I also finished up my first semester of being a teaching assistant for both the WSU anatomy class (which uses the Pullman WWAMI anatomy lab and cadavers) and a parasitology class. In both labs, I received high marks as a teacher and have been invited to be a TA for the anatomy class again for three labs. The professor of anatomy invited me to be a TA for another class he teaches, Comparative Anatomy. I will be teaching this class for two labs per week. I enjoy teaching and I believe it builds communication skills which all doctors should master.<br/><br/>	In addition to the five labs I mentioned above, which requires working 25 hours per week, I will also be working in the X research lab for 15 hours per week. I have worked there since September 2011 and have enjoyed this introduction to research. The research job and teaching assistant are both paid positions, resulting in me being a full time employee at Washington State University. The hours of work interfered with me being President of the Pre-Health Club, so I stepped down from my position after meeting with advisors and the new President to discuss what I planned for the club. I still will be a member involved in their volunteer efforts.<br/><br/>	During my time as President, my main volunteer work that I did was with the Pullman Food Banks. This semester we raised 1,651.5 pounds of food for the food bank. In total, the Pre-Health Club raised 3,592.5 pounds of food donations this last year. Raising food for the food bank has been main volunteering point this semester for the club and me. We raised food for the food bank because some Palouse families had difficulty obtaining food and because my past history using food banks as a child. <br/><br/>	I hope all of this is taken into consideration at the next meeting. I believe I will make a great addition to the class of 2017 at UWSOM. Of the schools that I have interviewed at, none have left such a dramatic desire to attend and work in the area as University of Washington has. I hope you will consider my recent graduation with two degrees, teaching experience, fulltime work and volunteer contributions to the food bank from this last semester. I believe my passion for medicine, experiences and my disadvantaged background will add diversity and be a contribution to the University of Washington School of Medicine class of 2017. I hope this new information is taken into account during the next EXCOM meeting when you vote on my application.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration,<br/>BABSstudent<br/><br/><h2>Update 3:</h2><br/>Sent early March by email.<br/><br/>Dear Executive Committee, <br/><br/>	Five months have passed since I interviewed at University of Washington School of Medicine. Since the executive committee will begin making the final group of acceptances, rejections and waitlist positions, I wanted to reaffirm my desire to attend UWSOM while also providing other updates in the hope of being accepted or gaining a higher position on the waitlist at my dream medical school.<br/><br/>	First, I have continued all of my jobs with Washington State University. However, one of my job titles has changed since my last update; I am now an instructor with the School of Biological Sciences (verifiable by searching my name on wsu.edu and clicking on the staff link). Previously my title was Teaching Assistant, but this semester it changed due to the higher amount of classes I teach. I will continue these instructor jobs until May and then work in the X lab full time until July. <br/><br/>	I have also contacted Dr. X and asked him if I could shadow him again, to which he responded I may. I will shadow Dr. X from Mid-March through April (verifiable by contacting Dr. X on my AMCAS application). Now that I have applied to medical school, I am investigating which specialty I would like to pursue with primary care being something I want to learn more about.<br/><br/>	In addition, I began moving towards my goal of being involved with the health aspect of my fianc�e�s elementary school class. I recently finished helping to create health lesson plans for her first grade students (verifiable by contacting X on my AMCAS application). The lessons rely heavily on preventative medicine; focusing on teaching the benefits of being active, brushing their teeth, eating a balanced diet and telling adults about problems they may have. This project culminated on the day before Dr. Seuss� birthday, March 1st, when I went to the class and talked to the students about my career goals and reading to them Dr. Seuss and other books about health and doctors. I hope to make this a yearly activity, as I have enjoyed this opportunity immensely. <br/><br/>	Finally, I have been told repeatedly that if I do not get into UW this cycle that I should apply the following cycle. However, I want to notify the executive committee that I have been accepted to Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine and Creighton University School of Medicine including a Medical Dean�s Scholarship for $100,000 over four years to CUSOM. I sincerely hope this does not change the committee�s view of my application to UW. <br/><br/>	While I am extremely grateful to been awarded a scholarship like this and admission to other medical schools, I am willing to turn down these offers to attend UW for admission to the class of 2017. Simply put, UW has many opportunities that I wish to utilize that do not exist at these other schools. The ability to stay in state, the underserved focus of UW that would allow me to use my B.A., the third and fourth year sites of WWAMI, the strong research funding UW receives, the primary care focus of UW, the mission statement of the school and my fianc�e�s teaching certification in Washington State are all reasons that we have placed UW at the top of our preferred medical school list. If granted an acceptance to UW, I will withdraw from my acceptances to the other medical schools without a second thought. <br/><br/>	I hope you consider this at the next meeting or when the waitlist is created. It has been a great honor to be invited to interview as well as remain under considered for admission. I hope my dreams to matriculate at UW come to fruition. I truly believe that I will be a great fit for the University of Washington School of Medicine and attending this school will be best choice for me. I hope you all see this too. Thank you for your time, consideration and work in creating the next generation of doctors. <br/><br/>Best of luck with your voting,<br/>BABSstudent</p>
