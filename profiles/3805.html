I was born in India, moved with my family to Canada when I was twelve and then to the United States at the age of fourteen. Each time we moved, I was exposed to new ideas and different people, bolstering my love for learning. I enjoyed discovering the nuances of the new accents, trying strange foods, and assimilating to a new culture, each very different from the last. After the move from India to Canada, I had access to the Internet for the first time. My fascination with this �new� technology inspired me to learn more about it. Over the following months, I taught myself web-programming languages and started a web designing business. My desire to teach is an outgrowth of my love for learning. In college, I trained fellow students in web development and hired them on a part-time basis to complete projects for my company. Through my teaching experiences as an undergraduate peer-tutor in Physics and Biology, I discovered that not everyone learns in the same way. I became aware of the importance of flexibility and simplicity, not only in teaching, but also in my interactions with others.</p><p>My exposure to disparate cultures enhanced my ability to relate to people from varying backgrounds. The first time I met the soccer team of four-year-olds I was to coach, I recognized the anxiety in their behavior; they hesitated to make eye contact or leave their parents' side. I remembered a similar feeling when I arrived in what seemed like a new world, having to find common ground with new people. I faced these situations many times, and each time I learned important lessons that helped me grow a little more as an individual. Utilizing the lessons I learned, I enjoyed making connections with my team members and helped them learn to relate better with each other. Assimilating to new situations is always challenging, but it gets easier with practice.</p><p>My parents made many sacrifices to reach America for the singular purpose of providing my brother and me with better educational opportunities. Along this journey, I had the opportunity to acquire a diverse cache of experiences and develop a passion for the educational opportunities available to me through the field of medicine. I hope to bring my empathetic nature and enthusiasm for learning to medicine and look forward to sharing with, and learning from the rest of the student body.</p></div></div><br><br><br><h1>Personal Statement 2010 - This is what I applied and got in with (surprisingly)</h1><div class="paul411activitysection"><strong>Prompt: </strong><em>Explain your motivation to seek a career in MEDICINE. Be sure to include the value of your experiences that prepare you to be a physician.</em><div class="paul411essay"><p>There was a train wreck! I grabbed my trauma kit and scrambled out of the ambulance with the rest of my emergency medical technician crew. One of the three damaged passenger cars had fallen on its side, its entrance severely constricted. Our team was divided into groups to cover each of the cars, with my team assigned to the car on its side. I felt a surge of adrenaline as we cautiously made our way into the compartment, laden with a bulky trauma kit. A pregnant woman�s cries rose above the rest.</p><p>This was just a simulation. The family and friends of the EMT students were the patients, dressed up with plastic molds, fake blood and makeup to simulate the appearance of injuries. The train wreck was among the many emergency simulations at the TEEX Emergency Services Training Institute. As I applied the knowledge I acquired and skills I learned over the last five months, I experienced how overwhelming it can be to turn practice into reality. Despite the stress induced by the patients� constant shouting for help amidst the initial confusion, I maintained my composure. I approached my first patient, a woman with a broken arm sustained in a fall. After introducing myself and reassuring her, I assessed her vitals and stabilized her arm with a splint. As we loaded her onto a backboard and carried her to the ambulance, I felt fulfilled knowing that I helped a person, even though the whole thing was merely a dramatization. </p><p>But then, the simulation suddenly became real when my partner, Chris, slammed his head against a sharp edge while exiting the train. He fell to the ground, unconscious. He was bleeding from a cut on his head, and one of his teeth was fractured. I called another team member for help, and then applied dressing to the cut to stop the bleeding. While another student stabilized the spine, I applied a cervical collar. Just as I finished obtaining vitals, the instructor and other EMTs arrived and we loaded my partner into the ambulance and took him to the hospital. Chris suffered only a minor injury, and he recovered almost immediately. Although I was nervous at the onset of the simulation and had some concerns about my skill level and ability to apply my classroom training to real-life performance, this experience proved to me that I had the ability to perform under pressure, take charge when necessary, and work effectively on a team in a stressful situation.</p><p>Once I started working in the emergency room, I provided better care with each patient contact. Hesitant at first to talk to patients, I chose to observe how the nurses and doctors handled them. I eventually developed my communication skills and soon was permitted to manage patients with little supervision. The amazingly rewarding experience of helping patients on emergency sites and in the emergency room reinforced my goal of pursuing a career in medicine.</p><p>I developed an ability to empathize with others and communicate effectively not only from my volunteer work as an EMT, but also from the extensive tutoring I did throughout my undergraduate years. In addition to volunteering at the university�s peer-tutoring service, I served a didactic role in study groups for nearly every class I took. When I participated in a study group for biochemistry, an especially challenging class, my peers asked me to conduct a review session before each exam.  My old study habits surfaced, and I spent several hours poring over notes, textbooks, and websites gaining a good understanding of the underlying concepts of the material in order to effectively explain the ideas to the group. This led to making my own pre-exam lectures which I presented to a study group of about twenty students. I was rewarded for my efforts not only by gaining a better understanding of the material, but also earning better grades and experiencing the satisfaction that I helped my peers.</p><p>My fascination with computers and technology began in elementary school, and by my freshman year in high school I started a web designing business, Faber Designs, that I continue to maintain on a part-time basis. Working as a web designer taught me important lessons in communicating effectively with clients and managing deadlines. In college, I combined my interest in computer science with scientific research in a neuroscience lab where I worked on the structural characterization of intraluminal synaptic vesicle filaments. In addition to performing traditional lab work, I wrote code for software that uses electron microscope images of synaptic vesicles at various angles to create three-dimensional reconstructions of the vesicles.</p><p>The discipline I learned from balancing time between academics, volunteering, and my web designing business has been crucial to achieving my goals. After working as an EMT, I can honestly say that helping others fulfills me unlike anything I ever experienced. I am certain that a career in medicine will allow me to use my academic ability and dedication to service to achieve that sense of fulfillment.</p></div><br/>Comments: I hate this personal statement. It's poorly organized, doesn't flow well, and generally sucks. I like the one I redid for reapplication (below) slightly more. I can't believe I got in with this (but to be fair, I got off a waitlist, makes sense).</div><br><br><br><h1>Personal Statement 2011 - revamped for reapplication; ended up not needing to reapply</h1><div class="paul411activitysection"><strong>Prompt: </strong><em>Explain your motivation to seek a career in MEDICINE. Be sure to include the value of your experiences that prepare you to be a physician.</em><div class="paul411essay"><p>There was a train wreck! I grabbed my trauma kit and scrambled out of the ambulance with the rest of my EMT crew. One of the three damaged passenger cars had fallen on its side, its entrance severely constricted. I felt a surge of adrenaline as we cautiously made our way into a train compartment, laden with a bulky trauma kit. It was only a simulation, staged near the end of my EMT training, but suddenly it became all too real.</p><p>My partner, Chris, hit his head on a sharp edge while exiting the train. He fell to the ground, unconscious and bleeding. Although on the verge of becoming overwhelmed, I maintained my composure, called another team member for help, and applied a dressing to stop the bleeding. Just as I finished obtaining vitals, the instructor and other EMTs arrived, and we loaded my partner into the ambulance. This experience left me with an appreciation for the ability to employ knowledge and training in stressful situations.</p><p>My understanding and appreciation of applied knowledge increased when I volunteered in the Emergency Room and shadowed doctors. I marveled at physicians as they collected patient information, synthesized the data to formulate a diagnosis, and explained their findings to the patients. They were driven by a passion for science and a desire to serve as they implemented their excellent interpersonal skills. My experiences confirm my belief that I will make an effective physician, as I share the same passions.</p><p>Along with my coursework in Biology, research has been one of my most satisfying scientific pursuits. I am able to use my love for science and develop my intellectual curiosity by applying acquired knowledge to solve problems. I assisted Dr. Harlow, setting up his lab and isolating synaptic vesicles. Once the bench work began, I experienced frustrations: experiments stalled while waiting for equipment to arrive, failed experiments, contaminated samples, and long hours. But I thrived on the dedication required and hard work demanded by the research, experiences that will undoubtedly prepare me for the pressures of medical school. I am currently working on a presentation of my work in developing an optimized protocol for isolating synaptic vesicles, a manuscript which will be submitted for publication early this fall.</p><p>In addition to academics, I remain dedicated to service. My experience volunteering as an Emergency Room Technician confirmed my desire to be a doctor. As the first hospital contact for walk-in patients, I am responsible for obtaining patients' relevant medical history, symptoms, and vital signs. After observing the nurses and conducting patient interviews myself, I developed an ability to ask relevant questions based on information related by frequently anxious patients and was able to put them at ease in uncomfortable situations. From my ER experiences, I discovered the importance and benefits of the doctor-patient relationship and welcome the opportunity to interact personally with patients. Often, I find myself listening to patients' concerns and stories and helping to allay their fears. I take comfort in the knowledge that I am assisting in make a patient�s hospital stay more pleasant, an experience that is more rewarding than I ever imagined.</p><p>Beyond research and volunteering, I worked on my interpersonal skills, an important component in the practice of medicine. I recall a valuable lesson I learned from Benjamin, a four-year-old I coached on my U5 soccer team, who informed me that he would play only if I gave him candy. Shortly after promising him a reward, he scored a goal�for the other team. He came to me to collect his treat, claiming that he had, in fact, �scored a goal.� In that moment I learned the importance of unambiguous communication. As the owner of a web designing business that I started in high school, I learned to communicate with clients, manage deadlines, and build lasting business relationships. In my sophomore year of college, I hired other students on a part-time basis to complete web-designing projects. Coordinating and managing the business has been a tremendous help in developing my communication and leadership skills.</p><p>There is no single event that ignited my desire to become a doctor, but rather a lifetime of experiences. My continued commitment to service, research, and clinical activities have galvanized my decision to pursue a career in medicine. My love for science and my ability to communicate effectively will serve me well. I am certain that as a doctor, I will be intellectually challenged and content knowing that I am using my passions and skills to help others.</p></div><br/>Comments: okay personal statement. It's rather cookie-cutter, in my opinion. Also, the EMT thing at the beginning of the essay is kinda lame.</div><br><br><h1>Letters of Recommendation</h1><div class="paul411activitysection"><strong>Sample Letter of Recommendation for medical school from a non-science professor:</strong><div class="paul411essay"><p>To Whomsoever It May Concern,</p><p>It is a true pleasure for me to write this letter of recommendation for Sherlock Holmes, who was my student in STAT 301, "Introduction to Biometry," in the spring semester of 2009. As his consistent and remarkable academic record shows, Sherlock is one of most brilliant students that I have taught. I would rank him in the top 5% of all undergraduate students that I have taught at Laplace University over the past 2 decades.</p><p>He is extremely inquisitive and always yearns to gain in-depth knowledge of the subject he is studying. For my class, he made it a point of thoroughly understanding the presented materials and seeking help outside class to gain a firm grasp on the fundamentals. Because of his conscientious manner and hard work, he consistently scored the highest grade in the class on all the exams in my class � a testament to his ability to synthesize newly learned materials and apply his excellent analytical and problem-solving skills.</p><p>In the fall of 2009, he enrolled in a demanding, semester-long emergency medical technician (EMT) course alongside fourteen hours of regular undergraduate coursework. The extra four hours a day, for three days a week he committed to attending the EMT course did not have the slightest adverse impact on his class attendance or grades. There is no doubt in my mind that he will be able to readily handle the challenging medical curriculum ahead with the same resolute work ethic, discipline, and perseverance he has demonstrated throughout his undergraduate career.</p><p>However, Sherlock's potential to succeed in the medical field exceeds mere academic prowess. He possesses a striking dedication, compassion, and willingness to using his time and talents to help others. He enjoyed working in the emergency room and on the ambulance so much that he volunteered over a hundred hours beyond the required internship hours at the local hospital and fire department. After discovering a strong interest in medicine from his EMT internships, he further explored his commitment to the medical field by continuing to volunteer as an 'ER Technician' at the hospital and as the 'Medic-in-Charge' for the first response team at the university's sporting events. Sherlock's well-founded desire to be a physician, which stems from his academic caliber and compassion, has been cemented by his ample first-hand medical experience.</p><p>Furthermore, Sherlock always displays amiable manners, gets along very well with others, and conducts himself professionally. Indeed, he has been very helpful to other students in his class by tutoring them for exams and actively contributing to group study sessions. Sherlock has achieved tremendous personal growth in the two years that I have known him. As a soccer coach for children in the local community, he showed incredible maturity in building rapport with the players and their parents. His ability to work well will people and appetency for service has greatly been enhanced by his volunteer work with Habitat for Bros, Chi-squared Soccer Club and the Bayes Medical Center.</p><p>In my conversations with Sherlock about his desire to become a doctor, I have developed a strong sense for the enthusiasm and potential that Sherlock demonstrates towards achieving this goal. I truly believe that his impressive academic caliber, positive attitude towards learning and others, and a passionate commitment to human service will make Sherlock an asset to your medical program and a competent and caring medical professional.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Dr. Norm Alkurve, PhD<br/>Laplace University<br/>Department of Statistics</p></div><ol><li>Non-science (shown above): <a style="padding:3px 3px 0 20px;font-weight:bold;background:url(http://img.pho.to/img/thumbs/d/doc.google.com_favicon.jpg) no-repeat top left" href="http://goo.gl/fIho0">Letter of Recommendation for Medical School</a> - from my statistics professor whose class I did really well in.

			<p>[I am in the process of typing up this section... will update very very soon]<br/><br/>MCAT (May 1 2010)<br/>1. Didn't prepare as well as I should have<br/>- I only started studying a month and a half before the test<br/>- I had to re-learn physics because I hadn't take it since AP Physics C in high school - not a good thing to cram<br/>- Wasn't able to learn as much organic chemistry as I'd like to<br/>2. Took 5 practice tests from AAMC and averaged around a 32<br/><br/>MCAT Score: 30P: 11BS 11PS 08VR<br/>1. Got score 30 days later<br/>2. Not too happy with the MCAT score, I think I can do better (Let's see from the May 26, 2011 retake)<br/>- Especially surprised about the verbal score, usually did better on practice tests<br/><br/>TMDSAS Submitted: June 12, 2010<br/>  - two weeks to process<br/>  - five weeks to transmit (transmitted on July 18, 2010)<br/>  - SUBMIT EARLY! (This is overstated but it's so helpful to submit early)<br/><br/>AMCAS Submitted: June 16, 2010<br/>  - two weeks to process (Processed: June 29, 2010)<br/>  - To be honest, I'd prefer to stay in Texas.<br/><br/>So far, interviews at (in order)<br/>1. Texas Tech - El Paso<br/>2. UTMB - Galveston<br/>3. Texas Tech - Lubbock<br/>4. UT Southwestern <br/>5. UT Houston<br/><br/>Still waiting on UTSA and Texas A&M.<br/>UPDATE: Texas A&M HSC didn't offer me an interview because I was a permanent resident and they already filled their slots or w/e with citizens or something like that. If this pertains to you, please be aware of this going in; it was an unwelcome surprise when I learned of it after applying.<br/><br/>UTSAHSC: There's some age-discrimination that goes on here: they don't like youngins :( The youngest student in the Class of 2014 was 21 (Source: http://www.uthscsa.edu/hscnews/pdf/SoM_Class2014_Statistics.pdf)<br/><br/>December 1st - No pre-matches :( FML<br/>MATCH DAY: ... nothing. Time to start over -___-<br/><br/>5/26/2011: Retook the MCAT<br/><br/>6/1/2011: Submitted TMDSAS for 2011 cycle<br/><br/>6/2/2011: Accepted to Texas Tech - Lubbock off the waitlist! But it's.. Lubbock :|<br/><br/>6/14/2011: Accepted to UTMB - didn't even know I was waitlisted! Pleasant surprise! (Matriculating here)</p>
