			<b>Brief Profile:</b><br/>
			When I was 5 years old I underwent surgery to correct a hernia. I distinctly remember the whole experience as it is my earliest memory of being in a hospital.  I can even remember the smell of the anesthesia as I fell asleep only to instantly wake up completely confused. At this moment I wanted to be a doctor. A few years later I awoke early in the morning to a large crash outside my house. As I looked out the window I saw our green trashcan knocked over and the garbage man maneuvering the mechanical claw on the side of his truck to pick it back up. At that moment I wanted to be a garbage collector. Throughout the next 10 years of my life I dabbled in many interests. I considered being a rock star, business executive, recording artist or even a professional figure skater. However it took a real life observation of the medical field for me to return to my original desired profession of medicine. It wasn?t until my junior year of high school that I began to think seriously about my future. I knew I liked science, and confused many of my friends when I decided to take biology and chemistry at the same time. It only made sense that a combination of these two would become my future college major. In the summer between high school and college I was recommended by my science teacher for a summer program known as ?Med Camp?. This involved three days of physician shadowing and other fun activities for those interested in healthcare. This could have been one of the greatest decisions in my life. I began to realize that my true interest in science was in its application to medicine. I stayed up until early in the morning talking with two 3rd year medical students and decided seriously that I want to be a physician. <br/>Medicine is the only profession I can predict myself enjoying for my entire life. Helping others makes me feel good about myself. I want to be able to have a direct positive impact on the lives of others. From presenting a softer, sensitive side to a friend while they explain an unfortunate event, or to taking blood pressure and vitals on a trauma victim I am truly happy to help. I tend to empathize strongly with the problems of others and will always offer help to someone who appears in distress. I am very frequently the designated driver that ends up spending the entire night caring for and checking on those who aren?t feeling well, and I?m proud of this role. If I am already able to feel rewarded from fairly little things, I cannot anticipate how indescribable it must feel to perform a life-saving surgical procedure. I am eager to learn how to help people in ways that only a doctor can. <br/>During my second semester of college I wanted to take my desire to be a physician to the next level and get involved in some sort of patient care, so I became involved in EMT training. I distinctly remember the first individual I cared for in a clinical setting. They had fallen from a third story balcony onto a parking lot and presented with anterograde amnesia. After taking vitals and being stabilized I was left alone to ?keep an eye on them? for a while. During the five minutes before he was taken for x-rays he asked the same two questions somewhere on the order of twenty different times. Each time I patiently explained where he was and what happened. After each cycle he calmed down and seemed reassured, and I was satisfied that I made feel slightly better many times. After this night I was extremely excited, I proved to myself that I enjoyed caring for sick and injured people and was absolute certain of my desire to be a physician.   <br/>The next night after handling various mild car accidents and sick people there was a second patent which I will never forget. She presented with a painkiller overdose in an attempted suicide.  Although I did little to care for this patient I was absolutely amazed in the dialogue between the physician and patient. The physician was so confident and reassuring that they commanded instantaneous respect and trust. I deeply want to gain the education necessary to tactfully and maturely handle similar situations. I know I possess the honesty and compassion necessary to work not only with patients but their whole family. <br/>I find myself ready to become a medical student. Through my experiences I have gained a realistic idea of the hard work and compromise required to gain the knowledge and skill necessary to save another?s life. I have determination and commitment to follow through. I know I have what it takes to not only graduate from medical school, but to gain acceptance into competitive residence programs. Hopefully one day soon I will become one of a new generation of doctors and contribute to the medical advances that are occurring constantly in the medical field.<br/><br/><br/>I have had my share of illness and understand what its like to rely on the help other others.   <br/><br/><br/><br/>Hallick <br/>Dr. Masel <br/>Dr lee <br/><br/><br/><br/>Techniques<br/><br/><br/>Activities<br/><br/>Southern Arizona Red Cross Health and Safety instructor<br/><br/>My role as a Health and Safety instructor authorized me to conduct classes in First Aid, AED use, stress management, injury prevention, and Adult Infant Child CPR.  I have currently certified over 250 individuals in First Aid and CPR from the diverse Tucson community.  Through my experiences in the community classroom, I have interacted with many different individuals: from retired doctors, veterinarians, epidemiologists, and university professors to truck drivers, police officers, life guards, and fellow students. This experience has drastically improved my public speaking skills, but more importantly, taught me how to connect with those who may be different from me. Because of this experience it has become increasingly easier for me to build the trust needed between instructor and student, regardless of any differences they may have. This skill will carry over to my interaction with future patients. I have developed the maturity necessary to work successfully with both children and those significantly older than me, along with those with varying levels of education. In addition through my involvement with the American Red Cross, I was able to observe numerous individuals who posess true altruism. Throughout my career as a physician I would like to learn from these individuals continue my involvement with the Red Cross by participating in disaster relief and other community service.   If only one of the students I instructed in First Aid and CPR is able to provide life saving first aid then I feel I have indirectly made a significant difference in another?s life. With each additional citizen trained in CPR and first aid, the entire community slowly becomes a safer place to live.  <br/><br/><br/>Red Cross Student Organization<br/><br/>After speaking with my friends about my involvement with the Red Cross I began to notice that most students had misconceptions that the Red Cross was only concerned with blood donation and disaster relief.  I decided to start a student service organization dedicated to informing students about the Red Cross, as well as supporting them through volunteer work.  After becoming recognized by both the Southern Arizona Red Cross and the University of Arizona, we were able to begin holding regular meetings. By December, our e-mail list had grown from about 10 of my friends to over 110 individuals from different areas of campus. The club consisted of Theater and English majors, to Engineers and Chemistry majors. Together, we each were able to offer a unique skills to assist the Red Cross.  Some began to volunteer with the veteran?s hospital through the Red Cross in the pharmacy and other positions. Others are currently in training to become Health and Safety instructors. This organization put students in touch with the Red Cross, who will continue to volunteer throughout their lives. In addition we held numerous events on campus where life saving CPR statistics and Red Cross course catalogs were passed out. At the end of the year we hosted a ?Could you Save a Life? event, where willing participants were asked to demonstrate what they would do in an emergency. This experience tested my skills as a leader as it took a considerable amount of time and commitment to gain momentum. I feel that is extremely valuable in my preparation to be a physician because commitment is an absolute requirement when it comes to patient care. I hope that throughout the next few years this student organization will continue to produce more student volunteers for the Red Cross.  <br/><br/>Biology Tutor/Undergraduate TA<br/><br/>As a Biology Undergraduate TA I re-attended every lecture of first year biology and held eight office hours per week where students had the opportunity to come meet at talk with me. One of the ideas behind this program is that freshman in college are more comfortable speaking with their peers than their professors. Once students began speaking to me I was able to help them  master the knowledge necessary to succeed in introductory biology,  and more importantly, offer advice pertaining to study skills and surviving university life. I worked consistently with the same students through the semester and was even able to see some improvement in their grades. If these students continue using my advice pertaining to test preparation and organization, or modifying them to fit their needs then maybe they will be able to avoid much stress later on in their academic career. In addition the training to become and undergraduate mentor consisted of learning numerous study techniques and strategies for success that could be applied to the first year of medical school. <br/><br/>HED outreach<br/><br/>Through this program, affiliated with the MESA program, I went to local Tucson high schools and discussed the college application process with students. The goal was to increase the percentage of students who enter a four year university directly from high school. I gained valuable insight on how to work with high school students and present a logical argument. For some students who have seen others become highly successful with no college degree it can be a rather daunting task to explain that they are the exception to the rule. Aside from using statistics I learned to employ easy-to-understand examples or situations to convey my arguments. Overall I feel that the biggest difference I was able to make was to ease the minds of those who were already considering attending a university but had an unrealistic expectation of what it involved.   <br/><br/>Middle school science program <br/><br/>Through this experience I designed and implemented science lesson plans at an under-served middle school. With over 90% of the school composed of Hispanic students I quickly learned to overcome with language barriers. I primarily used demonstrations and illustrations as well as a mediocre Spanish vocabulary to grab the attention of all students. I was surprised as the horrible conditions provided by the school for learning science. Most of the students strongly disliked or misunderstood what science was. After this realization is changed the focus of my lessons to showing how important science is, and that anyone with the right education can get involved. I learned to form professional student-teacher relationship with middle school age children. By providing a positive example and keeping these students off the street after school, I hope to have made a difference in their lives.  I would be thrilled if any of these students attend college to pursue a science related field. <br/><br/>EMT<br/><br/>The second semester of my freshman year I began taking the classes necessary to be a certified EMT. My purpose behind gaining this certification would be to gain patient interaction skills and ensure that medicine in the career I wish to be in. Unfortunately in Arizona I did not meet the age requirements necessary to become employed as an EMT but was still able to obtain the training. To become a certified EMT, it is required to spend time in an Emergency Department both observing and demonstrating the skills necessary. I will always remember this experience. Within my first 5 minutes of being in the emergency room, there was a helicopter transporting a victim of stab wound. I was very impressed by the manner in which the doctors assessed the patient and stabilized his condition within minutes. This experience will always leave a lasting impression on my mind. Throughout the night I was able to shadow emergency physicians and confirm that I want to be a doctor. Taking my EMT classes along with my University of Arizona classes required me to take 27 credit hours in one semester, and be a full time student at two colleges simultaneously. My EMT certification opened a new perspective for me in terms of healthcare related career options and opportunities. I attribute my EMT certification as the event which made me transform from a college freshman to a mature adult. <br/><br/>Guitar/Vocal Performance?s <br/><br/>Music is something that has always been important to me. In fact my original major was music education. However, after seeking advice from various music professionals, I decided that my enjoyment of music would be ruined if it were my profession. From my medical experience with Donor Network of Arizona I have not encountered this problem. I frequently use music as stress relief to balance my course work. I currently can sing, play trumpet and the guitar. I frequently visit Open Mike Nights at local coffee shops and enjoy performing. Having a productive way to release stress has been very important in my undergraduate education, and will continue to be so in medical school. <br/><br/>Lab experience<br/><br/>One system by which metal is regulated in E. coli is the Cus System. This systems is composed of four molecules; CusCFBA. CusCFB bind together to form a pump along the cell membrane and is responsible for the physical transport of metals out of the cell. The exact role of CusF is not completely determined. It is found freely throughout the cell and is capable of binding copper and silver. It is thought that CusF interacts with CusB in some way. The current research I am pursuing is the protein-protein interactions of CusF using In vivo crosslinking. The current method used involves the over expression of CusF to produce a significant amount of crosslinked proteins to submit for Mass Spectroscopy. However because of this high concentration in previous experiments CusF was seen to bind to molecules completely irrelevant to our investigation. A titratable promoter is currently being designed to vary the amount of CusF produced to hopefully gain meaningful results. Other factors such as the crosslinker used and time of reaction will also be varied to produce the best results. This project will continue until May 2007 when a formal Thesis will be written to fulfill the requirements to graduate with Honors B.S is Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics. A rough thesis summarizing current results will be available in December and can be submitted upon request.<br/><br/>Rosson House Tour Guide<br/><br/>The Rosson House Museum, named for its first owner Dr. Rosson, is the only Victorian home in phoenix, Arizona. As a tour guide, I am responsible for leading tour groups through the rooms of the house discussing the differences between Victorian and modern lifestyles, and answering questions. This experience drastically improved my public speaking skills, but more importantly, allowed me to overcome language barriers and interact with individuals from across the world. During my tours there were often visitors from France, Germany, Japan, and Mexico who did not speak English. Through the use of body language and hand gestures I was still able to communicate effectively, and allow the guests to have a good time. Due to its close proximity to other family attractions guests, frequently brought along young children. I incorporated various activities and talking points into the tour to grab the attention of the children as well as their parents. As a whole, this experience interacting with individuals from different cultures will be applied to my patients as a physician. Dr. Rosson was one of the towns only doctors during this time and a room in the home served as an emergency room for many years. In this room a vast collection of medical equipment from the time, and interesting physician manuals from the 19th century. I was fascinated to learn of the creative and sometimes harmful cures that were employed just slightly over a century ago. <br/><br/><br/>Donor Network of Arizona, Tissue/Ocular Recovery technician  <br/><br/>As an Tissue/Ocular recovery technician my primary responsibilities are to perform medical chart reviews to determine if tissue is eligible for transplant then to procure the tissue. Through my experience performing medical chart reviews I have seen first hand the vast amount of paperwork physicians and hospital staff must complete. As I read every single physicians order, progress note, or temperature taken, I am presented with a clear story of the patient?s admission. From repeated exposure I have followed what duties a physician performs in quick 15 minute ER admits, to longer month long treatment plans.  These comprehensive accounts of patient care provide an even more realistic view of a physician?s day at work. I have also seen the significant amount of paperwork and other tasks physicians must perform in addition to patient care, and I am more that willing to accept the added responsibilities and stress of being a physician not directly related to patient care. From this experience I also know I posses the technical skills necessary to be a physician. A typical cornea recovery can take up to three hours. During which, I am surgically scrubbed in while manipulating tiny castro scissors and scalpel to remove the cornea without puncturing the vitreous humor, creating stress lines, or absence cell patches on the cornea. From assisting with the removal of the hemi pelvis, femur, and pericardium I know I am able to physically endure the psychological stress of witnessing large amounts of blood and every other body fluid. <br/><br/>		</p>

			<p>I am Terrified! I took the MCAT in August and applied to most schools without knowing my MCAT score, Do you think i applied to too many reach schools?<br/><br/>been complete at almost all schools november 20th<br/><br/>12/28/06 My interview at albany went well! I am really really really hoping for an acceptance in 2 weeks!<br/><br/>1/10/06 Interview at Meharry went extreamly well but the campus isn't all that nice. Curriculum seems a bit extreme with the first semester being from june-december. Vandy was incredable, Hopefully i should hear back from Albany tommorrow.....ahhhhhhh<br/><br/>1/10/06 Accepted at Albany! overjoyed....<br/><br/>1/30/06: Not in U of A's first round of acceptances.. suprise suprise! But acceptance to Meharry balances out my negativity. Even though I have little interest in going there its still makes me feel warm inside!<br/><br/>12/13/06: Not in U of A's second round of acceptances...This isn't helping my self esteem...I decided for sure im going to michigan now...just to try to feel good about this process again!<br/><br/><br/>MSU 2011<br/><br/>Good Luck to All!</p>
