			<b>Brief Profile:</b><br/>
			Meh. I think I just did all the regular stuff but probably with less depth than many SDNers. I dont like research so I only did it sparingly. I really like volunteering and teaching and I did a bit more of that. I did have stuff in all of the categories and I was told a few times during my interviews that my application was strong all over. I got letters of recommendation from professors of classes in which I really excelled and who knew me well. One interviewer told me that my letters were very strong. I think I present myself well in interviews. Overall I think I had a strong application but other than numbers, my EC's were below to average and the 'personal' aspects of my application were pretty good but not exceptional. 		</p>

			<h2 style="padding-top: 15px;">Summary of Application Experience</h2>

			<p>I'm aiming for 9-15 interviews!  I have no idea how well this will all work out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I attended a large public school in America. Please help me figure out where to apply! Generalized help is welcomed too. The above schools are under consideration. A star indicates that I will apply there for sure.<br/><br/>5/9/08 Damn bio class<br/><br/>Wow! That's a lof of schools. I'm a little bit worried that secondary essays will destroy me<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>5/15/08 Became even more obsessed with maintaining anonymity. I guess the only step left is to give the med schools code names<br/><br/> Heading abroad for the summer!<br/><br/>6/4/08 application almost complete but stupid transcript is going to hold me up a bit. I'm also thinking that applying to 25-26 schools is silly but I really don't know how to further cut it down.<br/><br/>submitted primary. Mom says my application is 'very good'   :-) Mom always knows best<br/><br/>amcas processed<br/><br/>7/10/08 Have already submitted Penn, Columbia, Hopkins, Ohio State at this point. <br/><br/>7/21/08 Submitted Miami, Pittsburgh, Michigan, Yale, Wake Forest, SUNY Upstate<br/><br/>7/30 Submitted Northwestern, Boston University, Tufts, Baylor, Dartmouth.<br/>I'm thinking about not completing Utah and Colorado. If I receive some interview love in the next couple of weeks then I will drop them for sure<br/><br/>Apparently Michigan thinks it's too good for my undergrad<br/><br/>7/30/08 Pitt Interview Invite!! HOORAYY. <br/><br/>8/2/08 Submitted Virginia.. Running.. out.. of energy..<br/><br/>8/4/08 Vanderbilt Invite and secondary. Ecstatic about the interview!! not so ecstatic about filling out another secondary.<br/>I thought someone would have for sure rejected me by this point.<br/><br/>8/12/08 Virginia Invite!! I'm loving life! I can't wait to road trip all over the place.<br/><br/>I submitted NYU and OHSU sometime in the last week. SLowing down b/c of stupid lab class but am still planning on finishing at least three more secondaries<br/><br/>I'm hoping for a good northeast interview invite to go back to back with Suny upstate. Here's hoping for dartmouth!<br/><br/>9/9/08 Wow, I've got 10 interviews and no rejections at this point. I feel incredibly fortunate. I wish these darn interviews were more spread out. I wish i had more confidence in myself to apply to less schools as well. <br/><br/>Vanderbilt was my first interview trip and quite an experience as I have never been to the south before (or does florida count?)<br/>Impression of Nashville: Got out of airport at around 630- 700 and I still felt like I was walking around in a pool of sweat. Crazy heat and humidity continued throughout the night. People in nashville really do seem to have the famed 'southern charm.' However, I'm learning that this charm and generosity may be quite shallow and ingenuine. My shuttle driver seemed very nice until he spouted some completely unexpected racist statement. I'm not sure that I've ever heard such an overt display of racism before. <br/><br/><br/>Vandy Interview: It was good and I think I would be happy there but I wasn't as impressed as I expected. There were some things that disappointed me but overall I would be thrilled to get an acceptance and ultimately go here. Students' quality of life seems high and thats a HUGE plus to me.<br/><br/>11 interviews, no rejections. I never thought that I would wish that the interviews would stop coming but it's getting to that point. I have a hard time saying no to more interviews but my money is depleted and more acceptances will make for a tough choice next spring. I really hope that I get a substantive scholarship somewhere that I like so I won't have to fret about making a decision. I'm not counting on it happening though<br/><br/>12th interview at UCLA. Is this my first choice? Who knows. It's on the same side of the coast as my family and has really low student indebtedness (althought I am OOS).<br/><br/>I really have no way of explaining why I am having this much success. I think I had some ridiculous letters or something. I didn't think my application was especially strong at all!<br/><br/>Put on hold at Michigan- It's actually relieving that I might not get an interview somewhere.<br/><br/>Vandy is growing on me for some reason. Well see how my upcoming interviews go.<br/><br/>Another interview at Wake Forest.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed my interview at pitt. I really liked the campus. Big, Tall impressive buildings. My interviews went well too. I think everyone's interviews went well though. I'm not sure that I fit in well with the students. My first night in Pitt I got pulled over by the police for driving the wrong way on a one-way street. Nice.<br/><br/>This is going to be an interesting season. I never thought I would be this successful based on my paper application. I think I'm probably more impressive in an interview than on paper. I think I'll have a strong response. I guess the challenge will be finding the right school for me. It's nice to be in this position.<br/><br/>I have a theory that it's impossible to have a bad impression of someone who always is smiling. I've been using this strategy as much as possible. I try to get my interviewer to smile as much as possible as well. I suppose well see how well this strategy works.<br/><br/>Charlottesville, VA-  Wow! What a beautiful campus and a great college town. Makes me wish that I went to undergrad here. <br/><br/>UVA was great! I love the prospect of staying in such an engaging college environment (rather than some med center far away from student life.) Some students seemed a touch self absorbed but maybe it was just a bad day. Charlottesville is perfect for me, the campus is beautiful and the facilities are also great. I'm really really hoping for an acceptance on Oct. 16 when I supposedly should receive a decision. However, of the interviews that I've had so far, I think these were my weakest. I kind of fumbled through quite a few questions. Fingers are crossed<br/><br/>Hoping for interviews at Penn, Yale, Baylor, UCF , Michigan (still bitter about their autoinvite policy but I'm still on board due to their reputation for giving scholarships)<br/><br/>Still really stoked on UVA. Time is going by oh so slowly until October 15.<br/><br/>14th interview at Utah. I figure that if I can't get an acceptance with 14 interviews then I don't belong in medicine. There will be no reapplication.<br/><br/>Portland- Already sold on Portland before my visit. Loved the school too. I kind of walked into a trap in one of the interviews but I think it was relatively minor. The cost of attendance is prohibitively high. It's a real shame that they can't make tuition somewhat reasonable for OOS applicants. The students here were BY FAR the most friendly that I have met yet. It could have been because we were the second interview group of the year, but everyone seemed really excited to talk to us. I haven't seen this yet at any school.<br/><br/><br/><br/>JHop rejection. Called in asking about status of app and they wrote back with a rejection! Maybe this will help cut me back down to size after having WAY more success than anticipated. At the same time, JHop is probably the worst fit imaginable for me. <br/><br/>Ohio State- This college feels like my undergrad but even bigger. This is not a good thing. Too much football extremism for me as well. I'm probably judging med schools way too much by the feel of their respective colleges, but I think these things do matter to some extent.<br/><br/>I'm realizing more and more that I enjoy smaller cities to bigger ones. I'm really looking forward to visiting Dartmouth in the next couple weeks.<br/><br/>I think I'm probably done getting interview invites with maybe the exception of a straggler or two. It was one hell of a run. I've got a sneaking suspicion that I didn't get in to Virginia :-( .  Or maybe I'm just trying to read in to things too much.<br/><br/>Ohio State Interviews went well. I had two faculty interviewers simultaneously firing questions at me at once! With hard questions too! One of them was supposedly 'in training' but he was just as relentless as the other! I wasn't too happy that he asked me how many schools I had applied to and how many schools I have been to interviews at. I tried to give vague answers but he wanted numbers. I gave it to him. Damn, I wish I wasn't so honest. Thank god he didn't ask how many interview invites I have.Despite the high intensity and some really hairy questions, I think I did fairly well. At the end they said I was an exceptional candidate! Wow! I was blown away! So flattering! Anyway, it was a cool school but I worry about size issues. If I don't get in, I'll have a strong hunch that it was because my interviewer doesn't think I'll come here based on how many schools I applied to. He gave me the impression that he'd love for me to come, but that when all was said and done I would choose some place else. I wish I could have told him that I don't give a crap about rankings and will be picking my school based almost solely on where I think I will be the most happy. Damn, I really wish he hadn't asked how many schools I applied to, interviewed at,etc. That kind of stuff really isn't fair for applicants. I think we deserve some privacy in this crazy process. Maybe I'm reading too much into this too. I dunno? More tidbits: I absolutely love the independent study pathway. We'll see whats up in the next couple of weeks with decisions.<br/><br/>Okay, I guess the interview love doesn't stop here. UCF! This really is huge. No debt? Huge!<br/><br/>Columbia- New York City is great. I walked around the area (spanish harlem)  the night before my interview by myself and was captivated. What an interesting neighborhood. I didn't feel all that safe, but I kept walking anyway. The students that I met the night before were great- very friendly and sociabke. My interview day was a little bit less impressive. My interviewer definitely fit the ivy league elitist stereotype that sometimes plagues Columbia. In conversation, we rarely strayed far from his experiences at Harvard, Oxford. It was disappointing. I didn't have much in common with him and I'm pretty sure that I won't be getting an acceptance at Columbia- especially considering that only like 20% of interviewees are accepted. Overall, I think it is a great place. The students are very close and they all seem to have a lot of stuff going on outside of class. The students seemed great, actually. Overall, I think the biggest thing going for columbia is New York. This may be the case for all the New York schools. <br/><br/>Miami Interview Invite<br/><br/>Northwestern Interview Invite. How foolish medical schools are<br/><br/>In the middle of a big interview road trip during Oct 15.<br/><br/>Received a 'deferred' decision from Ohio State. This was soooo surprising as my faculty interviewer who was on the adcom basically told me that I was getting in. Wow, kinda disheartening. One thing that may have affected things is my leaving a packet of information in the adcom meeting room after they explicitly told us not to forget our stuff. I dunno if that kind of thing would be enough to turn around a school's decision. Either way, it's discouraging. I hope this isn't a sign of what's to come. Ughhh.<br/><br/>Praying for Virginia at this point! It's going to be one hell of a bad day if I get waitlisted/rejected.<br/><br/>Been on a long interview road trip and been a bit too busy to update.<br/>My perceptions of schools are as follows:<br/><br/>University of Vermont- I love Burlington and I love Vermont. The medical school has beautiful new facilities and I really liked the students that I met and the general vibe that I got at the school. The undergrad campus is great/beautiful (students are beautiful too). Lots of outdoorsy people/ etc. I didn't like the heavy primary care focus though. I basically LOVED the school but probably wont be going there as the OOS tuition is RIDICULOUS. It's a shame. <br/><br/>SUNY Upstate- Liked the school but not ecstatic about it. It kind of blended in with the rest of the schools that I visited. Syracuse seems a nice little town. I didn't meet a lot of students but they pretty cool. I wouldn't be surprised if my three male tour guides are in a boy-band w/ each other. They were nice though. My student interviewer was ADORABLE. I talked to her for probably an hour and a half. Such a cute girl. Talking to her definitely was the high point of the day and it definitely brought SUNY to higher regards in my mind.<br/><br/>Dartmouth- I tried SO hard to like Dartmouth. It seemed perfect on paper. After interview day I was a little bit disappointed. Hanover seems cool. I don't think I would mind living in such a rural area too much. The biggest turnoff to me was D'mouth's facilities. Their medical school is extremely dark, dreary and old. They have by far the least impressive facilities that I've seen at a school. My tour guides were unenthusiastic and unprepared and these were the only two students that I met. I wish I had had time to walk around and find other medical students to talk to. The financial aid, on the other hand, seems incredible and this makes a big difference to me! DMS seems a bit like the neglected college on campus which is a real shame. Dartmouth Hitchcock hospital seemed great, however! A beautiful place. I bombed my first interview. It was my third interview in three days and I genuinely was too tired to act coherent... ugh. Second interview went a bit better. At this point I'm not as excited about dartmouth as before my interview and if I had to guess, I would say that I won't be accepted. Well see<br/><br/>NYU- Great location. I LOVED this school and as you can probably see above, I'm a tough critic. Love the pass/fail, facilties, students, everything. I just don't know if I could do New York City. It might be too overwhelming for me. I don't know if I could deal with the lack of free space and people everywhere. Nevertheless, great school.<br/><br/>Boston U-  Boston is incredible. Easily the most desirable large city to live in in the country. That been said, it is very expensive (BU's calculated living expenses were much more than NYU and Columbia.) The school kind of seemed like every other school I've interviewed at. Wasn't terribly impressed, but wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>Acceptance at UVA!! Good god. Wow! After 11 interviews, this was my favorite school. I'm so excited. Unless a lot of money is thrown at me or some other unforeseen circumstance, I will be in Charlottesville next year. This school was perfect for me! I will probably be canceling a couple interviews.<br/><br/>Okay, I'm pretty sure that I'm done getting interviews. Of the 5 that I haven't heard from, I would probably go to interviews at four. I'm more than happy with what I've got now, however.<br/><br/>Utah interview- This is a good school that suffers from a bad dean of admissions. Beyond his smugness and reluctancy to do anything but threaten interviewees, Utah really is a nice place to go to school... Just don't expect to ever be told about it. My interviewers were great, students were very friendly, the medical education building is gorgeous with beautiful views and the school has access to some of the best outdoors stuff in the world.<br/><br/>Waitlist at Pittsburgh. A little bit sad about this one, but barring a scholarship I wouldn't have gone here over Virginia. Apparently waitlist movement doesn't begin until May. I won't be waiting on this one. Yayyy UVA!!<br/><br/>Hmm, maybe I'm not as good at interviewing as I think. Or maybe my application just isn't that strong, hehe :-)<br/><br/>Acceptance at Vermont! Wow, this was really surprising- not because I thought my interview was poor or anything but because I heard that OOS people are almost all waitlisted. I loved Vermont and would be really happy there but the OOS tuition is not manageable :-(. If you're instate it would be a shame to pass up though!<br/><br/>My UCLA interview day was absolutely incredible! This was by far my best interview day. I'm going to need to collect myself before I write more about it.<br/><br/>My thoughts right now after a lot of interviews. <br/>1. UCLA or Virginia (accepted!)<br/>3. NYU or Vanderbilt (I find myself quite unenthused about their research requirement)<br/><br/>My ranking of schools is highly dependent on cost and thus a scholarship from another school or a lousy financial package from a favorite school could heavily switch up my little ranking.<br/><br/>SUNY Upstate Waitlist?? This I straight up don't understand. This definitely bruises my ego and makes me feel less confident. Maybe I'm not as good a interviewee as I think :-( . <br/><br/>Update a week later: Less confident? pff...no. I just wish I could have heard what happened in that SUNY adcom meeting. At this point im still Really stoked on Virginia but holding out for UCLA. It's going to be an ugly mess if I get in. Still debating whether to go to northwestern. Is wanting to see chicago a legit. reason to go? I will be for sure doing one more interview at UCF and am excited about it. Other than that, nothing has happened in a loooonngg time. This process has become very boring over the past month. I'm wondering if I will get a late interview invite from someone. Yale would be nice. I'm really surprised that I haven't been offered an interview there thus far, but thats just the game I guess. Will update when something else noteworhty happens.<br/><br/>hold/waitlist thingy at vanderbilt. I'm kinda getting worked post interview. I really don't know why. Weak ec's maybe?<br/><br/>Accepted at UCLA. This is completely ridiculous. I loved UCLA. It's going to be a dogfight til the end between UVA and UCLA. These were by far my two favorites. It's probably going to come down to cost. I'm extremely lucky.<br/><br/>School preference<br/><br/>1. Virginia ( accepted), UCLA (accepted)<br/><br/> big break<br/><br/>3. NYU, Vanderbilt (waitlist), Pittsburgh (waitlist)<br/><br/>big break<br/><br/>6. The rest<br/><br/>I think its so crazy how I've gotten in to the schools that I loved and have been waitlisted at the schools that I wasn't so crazy about. This really has worked out well <br/><br/>Well, NYU acceptances have been given out to some folks. This process is SOOO bizarre. I thought for sure my lousy essays would have made getting interviews hard, and that once I got to the interview process I'd knock em dead and have a high acceptance ratio. It looks like the exact opposite is happening and I don't understanding it. Maybe I went into interviews with too much confidence or didn't take them seriously enough. I seemed to be MUCH more laidback during my interview days than other students in my interview groups. Maybe they perceived that as immaturity or something. Or maybe they more closely reviewed my application and noticed that my activities are actually somewhat superficial... <br/><br/><br/>Early January- Happy new year! Acceptance from BU and an interview invite for yale on the same day! It was nice to hear some good news although I wont be going to BU and I'm undecided as to whether I will interview at yale. I wish they had asked me earlier- they probably aren't all that interested in me.<br/><br/>Oh boy, how to pick a school? I only applied to one college and thus this situation feels quite foreign to me. I'm still in disbelief that UCLA accepted me as an OOS student. At this point, I'm pretty much only considering three schools unless someone else throws me money: UCLA, UVA, YALE (If I can actually gather the money/gumption to attend my interview there and get accepted somehow. I kind of look like someone who'd fit right in in LA but I actually despise pop-culture and UCLA is right in the heart of all that business. A big consideration for me is being in an environment where I feel inspired. Writers, scholars and politicians inspire me, not celebrities. I've lived briefly in New Haven, CT (home of Yale) a couple summers ago. I found the quality of life there to be quite low actually (its a dump) but I've never felt so inspired in my life. I really welcome the possibility of being an eternal student without going on to do anything productive in life. Yale seems to offer this opportunity should I choose to draw out my medical degree and/ or pursue other degrees. UVA is extremely high/at the top of my list because of the extremely high quality of life that can be had in C'ville. I loved the town and felt that I would fit in there better than at any other school. A great financial deal at UVA would be a clincher; I would show no hesitation in turning down a UCLA or a Yale. Time will tell , I suppose.<br/><br/><br/>Haven't written forever. Decided to add my numbers but they are a little bit jumbled up. I have been recently waitlisted at NYU and Columbia and accepted at Ohio State. the adcom at Ohio State are game players! It's okay- I am too<br/><br/>It looks like I will be getting a very good financial aid package which could keep me with VERY manageable debt. I still think I would be most happy at UVA and if it werent for the extra debt I would be going there. I will be attending second look weekends at both uva ucla. If yale lets me in that will be a consideration as well even though I kind of hated it during my interview. I know this sounds inconsistent but this process has the tendency to drive applicants a bit crazy.<br/><br/>Waitlist KING!! A brand new batch a waitlists for yall<br/><br/>20k/yr scholarship offered at university of virginia. This offer may be too good to turn down. I would be very happy at university of virginia. I need to go to second look weekend at UCLA to find out for sure.<br/><br/>4/15 Acccepted from waitlist at University of Utah. This school is not doing so hot right now and I need a break from Utah.<br/><br/></p>
