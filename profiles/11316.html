			<p>See my prior year's profile: 01709<br/><br/><br/><br/>August 01, 2006 - Well looks like it's time to reapply...I am giddy as a school girl and will probably shriek when I hit submit. I have become an AMCAS whore, since they pimp me out to med schools to get money. Anyways, I still haven't submitted and will hold out untill Aug 04, 2006 to submit. If anyone has any schools in mind that I should apply to, please let me know. Toodles. <br/><br/>August 04, 2006 - Got my long awaited closure from SLU and yep, it's a rejection...why break a three years old tradition. Anyways, that cements me moving to Virginia. Added a couple more schools, EVMS, Creighton, U of Nebraska. <br/><br/>August 07, 2006 - Went to St. John's to tie up the loose ends. Requested that the transcript be sent to AMCAS and paid up for up to 20 LORs. Went to Virginia on Saturday, and finally saw the place where I'll be living for the next 11 months. It's small (but is real estate term, that means it's cozy) but I like it. The landlords are very cooperative, didn't want any advances or securities, just the rent for this month and even gave me a TV and a treadmill to boot.  <br/><br/>August 18, 2006 - After a lot of thought to overcome a major writer's block...I finally got a decent PS. This process was really helped along by fellow SDN-er 'The Brown Note' (avatar with a seal wearing some sort of flowery neck brace). Muchos gracias to Brown Note for the invaluable help. So once the PS was straightened out,  submitted AMCAS....$760.00. <br/><br/>The SMP program is no joke. Seriously, this program is intense. The sheer amount of material that is covered per lecture is insane. Anyone who is unsure about medical school should do a SMP to get their priorities straight. My fellow SMPers are very smart people and at times have me sriously saying 'holy spit...what am I doing here?' Exams are coming up pretty soon, so basically this program can break me or make me.     <br/><br/>August 25, 2006 - Received notification from AMCAS that my transcript has been received (yay!) all that remains is verification (pre-mature yay!). I am in the 2nd week of the SMP and I can sum up the acadmic portion of it in one phrase: 'It's a massive clusterfuck of information'. That's basically it. I am trying my best to keep up with the classes (esp. embryology) but I am still 4 lectures behind (boo!)...but hey, that's what the weekends are for, right? (boo!) Toodles. <br/><br/>September 03, 2006 - My first exam in the SMP is coming up...it's Immunology. I feel so lost right about now. I went through about half the lectures and some stuff from the book but I really don't know what to expect. I have been away from books for such a long time (since taking the MCAT in April 2005) that I feel a bit overwhelmed. I think that since I am slo getting old my memory ain't what it used to be. My AMCAS still hasn't been verified. They seem to be taking a little longer this year. I think this entire verification process every single year is kinda useless, especially if you have graduated. They should just simply disallow any changes after the first complete transcript submission. Oh well, can't fight the system. Embryo exam is coming up on 09/21 and I gots to tell you that I am shitting bricks at the thought of it. Embryo lectures have become a one hour skullfucking every morning for me. I can hear what they are saying, stuff isn going in one ear and coming out the other ear but it isn't registering. Well, here's to me being part of the statistics for  the SMP who will likely fail out. Cheers.  <br/><br/>September 15, 2006 - My first official medical school examination is coming up and it's Embryo. Embryo is a 2 credit class that hits you as fast and strong as a fart and disappears just as quickly, leaving you scratching your head trying to figure out what concoction of food will produce such effect. So, I am at the being hit with the smell phase of embryo.<br/><br/>AMCAS still hasn't been verified. I think they implemented a new system or something. They probably think I suck so bad that they're not even gonna verify me. You'd think that verification of the same freakin grades for the FOURTH time would go by faster. Alas...no. I got a couple of secondaries so, even without being verified, I am still spending money....only in America, folks. <br/><br/>September 20, 2006 - Well, touch me softly....AMCAS has been verified!!! First jump over the flaming hoop in done...a few more left. Got Embryo exam tomorrow...and I am so royally screwed. Since it's a 150 questions, I'm hoping I can get a lot more wrong and get out with a reasonable score. If anyone wants to experience med school, go enroll in an SMP. I'm glad that I didn't get into med school last year and instead have the SMP as a precursor before med school. Anyways, I gotta go and study germ layers.   <br/><br/>September 26, 2006 - Requested that my LORs be sent to the following schools:<br/>Albany Med<br/>Drexel<br/>NYMC<br/>SLU<br/>Suny Downstate<br/>Suny Upstate<br/>Suny Buffalo<br/>UVM<br/>UMDNJ-NJMS<br/><br/>October 01, 2006 - Requested that my LORs be sent to following schools:<br/>GWU<br/>Penn State<br/>Rosalind Franklin<br/><br/>October 02, 2006 - Nice start to a week. Really screwed up on my CMP exam. I am gonna have to bust my hump for the next two exams. Also, got a secondary from VCU. I think they screen or something, so, that's a step in a positive direction. I am so unmotivated right now. I am trying to do good in the SMP but I just can't get enthusiastic about it. After jumping through so many hoops for the last few years, I am really tired at this point. I wanna give a shout out to ex-SMP and fellow SDN-er Tacrum (he has a porcupine (correction: echidna) on his avatar) for the helpful advice he's given me thus far. Thanks Tacrum. I got a MIM exam next week, so I need to go cram...I mean study. <br/><br/>October 05, 2006 - No love from Nebraska....corn sarn it. Oh well, this is the first to bite the dust. <br/><br/>October 06, 2006 - Got secondary from EVMS. I think they screen (?). I am still waiting on Drexel. Come on, Drexel, you know I want you, stop playin' around dammit. <br/>Also requested that LORs be sent out to:<br/>EVMS<br/>VCU<br/><br/>October 10, 2006 - Got a secondary from Loyola. I think these guys screen. I also got a letter from Wake Forest...I know those guys screen. The letter was sent to my dad's address so he had to read me the content over the phone. Apparently before I can get a secondary, I will need to verify from my advisor as to when I will get my graduate degree. I actually got a couple of screened secondaries (VCU, EVMS, Loyola), which is a step in the right direction. As you can clearly see it don't take much to make me happy. Also requested that LOR be sent out for: Temple. <br/><br/>October 17, 2006 - Finally received the secondary from Drexel...Hallelujah...rejoice all!!! I have been waiting on this secondary forever. I think I have a non-sexual crush on Drexel which is only rival to my love for SLU and SUNY Upstate. I love the curriculum that Drexel has and hoping that I get an interview from them. Also requested that LOR's be sent to Loyola. <br/><br/>October 18, 2006 - Got a notification from NYMC that they will deem my file complete without letters from my evaluator at Georgetown, but they are still expecting it around January. I really don't know what this means with respect to my application but sounds strangely like a hold your file until we get LOR notification. Oh well, I still haven't gotten my microbio test back. I am starting to hate this 'Gripe Period' crap they have. Back in my days, we didn't complaint so much. And honestly, the exam to me at least was fair so I left my gripe note empty. But I did notice some people writing 3 freakin' paragraphs on the gripe sheet. At any rate, have a microscopic anatomy exam on 10/30. I never liked histology, even in undergrad and I like it less now since, there is tons of material. But I love the labs though. It's like a slideshow you see when you visit relatives who just came back from a trip...'This is me and Harold at the Grand Canyon'...'Oh and this one is Harold catching a large-mouthes Bass...isn't that precious?'.  <br/><br/>October 23, 2006 - Had preliminary form letters from Georgetown sent out to all schools. And the advisor sent out a special letter to Wake Forest pertaining to the date when I will receive my degree. Hoping for a secondary from them. <br/><br/>October 25, 2006 - Received notification from SUNY Buffalo that they need copies of my green card. Sent it out today. <br/><br/>November 06, 2006 - Almost done with the secondaries save for Georgetown. I am still undecided about Albany. Got the answer key for my microscopic anatomy exam back and sweet lord did I bomb that test. I bacially dropped a frakin' nuclear warhead on that exam. The good news is I still have one more exam and I can't mourn about this one too long because I have a CMP exam on Friday. Yay for sporadic examinations! <br/><br/>November 07, 2006 - Yay...finally got the Wake secondary. My Dad called to let me know I got the secondary from Wayne State. I think these guys are screeners (?). Huzzah. <br/><br/>November 09, 2006 - Called SUNY Upstate yesterday as a distraction instead of studying for CMP. The lady put me on hold for like 5 minutes during which I entertained various notions about what she will say when she comes back.<br/>1) You've been selected for an interview.<br/>2) We've noticed that you applied here 4 times, so we just outright accepted you.<br/>3) You've been rejected.<br/>4) You've won $1,000,000.00 in the 'SUNY shows love to desperate in-state resident sweepstakes'.<br/>But I didn't get anything like that. Instead it was 'letters are being mailed out today or tomorrow'. Sigh...letters...that can only mean a 'hold'. Ba..byee Upstate.     <br/><br/>November 15, 2006 - Woke up this morning and as I approched the bathroom to powder my nose amongst other things, I was greeted with a nasty smell and a low guttural noise. I opened the door to find out that the water that remains inside the toilet has decided to explode outward and contaminating everything in my bathroom and the plumbing was making this horrific noise like it's going to let out a deep and loud belch. I closed the door quickly untill I was sure that things had settled down. What a perfectly lovely way to start the day.  <br/><br/>Anyways, LOR to Wake Forest was sent out. <br/><br/>My Dad called to let me know I got a letter from SUNY Upstate. And lo and behold....my prediction is true...it's a hold. Nostradamus can learn a thing or two from me. Upstate had been one of my top choices for four unflinching years but over the same four years, they have made it abundantly clear that I am no where near their top choice. Time to go wallow in the all too familiar self-pity. <br/><br/>November 20, 2006 - Called EVMS in the morning to find out that I have been rejected pre-interview. I really liked that school and thought I had a shot at an interview....shows what I know. Also, submitted the secondary for Wake Forest. Also, requested that LORs be sent out for the last two schools on my list: Wayne State and Georgetown. <br/><br/>November 26, 2006 - Got back from NY...the travel time took an ungodly 7 hours. My butt had lost all feelings from sitting for so long and ass grooves were made. Before leaving, found out my rejection from EVMS had arrived along with a rejection from RFU. I really wanted the opportunity to interview there but no dice. So far, have had 4 rejections, 1 pre-sec, 1 delayed hold/rejection and 2 post sec. And it's almost December. Here's hoping the interview Gods smile upon me soon. I'll even do a naked dance around a bonfire...I do that anyways but having a goal will make it more rational. Got my final MA exam on Monday, Dec 4th. I still have major stuff to go over and to make matters worse, I caught the flu in New York which manifested itself yesterday after I got back. That should really help me study. <br/><br/>November 29, 2006 - Called Drexel since it passed the four weeks mark and last year I received an interview exactly 4 weeks post-completion. Lightning does not strike twice and the guy answering the phone told me to expect an e-mail. Is Drexel rejecting via e-mail now? Also, called VCU...1+ month after completion and my file has still not been forwarded to the committee. Seems like no interviews for birthday this year. <br/><br/>December 01, 2006 - Drexel answers e-mails....it's true, oh it's true. They do not answer in a timely manner mind you, but eventually you should get a response. Apparently my file still hasn't been reviewed and I have been told to contact them should I not have heard from them in the next 2 weeks. NYMC sent an e-mail to me and half the population on SDN saying diddly squat. I got excited when I saw the e-mail header reading NYMC. Also UVM status page changed to: <br/><br/>Dear Rayhan:<br/>Your file is complete and has been preliminarily reviewed. You are within a pool of applicants from which an interview may be extended. Please note that this does not guarantee you will be offered an interview and you may not see an update to your status for several months. <br/>Our interview season runs from September through April and you will be contacted via email if you have been selected to interview.<br/><br/>I didn't get this last year on my status page but when I contacted them about my status, the reply somewhat resembled this. UVM seems to like non-traditionals and I think I am a non-trad....I mean not going straight to med school and all from college. Here's to hoping for something good. <br/><br/>December 07, 2006 - First semester at GT is officially coming to an end and histology collectively kicked my ass. Complete at Wayne State and Wake Forest..come on interview. Both schools are places where I will go in a heartbeat but they are both polar opposites of each other. Wayne is in a big city, urban area, great clinical exposure whereas Wake is in a small town, excellent facilities and great clinical exposure. Ah advanced choices. <br/><br/>Also, my brand new spankin'  LOR from Georgetown have been sent out to every school. The letter writer seemed really nice and fast! Less than a week since I met with her and she already finished. <br/><br/>December 13, 2006 - Called Wayne State and was told that I am in the 'possible interview' pile. I am so tired of these words: possible, potential, maybe, can't, many, qualified, applicants, year. So as of mid December...no interviews but according to what an ex-SMP told me (see comments) apparently this is the norm. Oh well, but his/her helpful comments will still not stop me from getting my panties in a twist. Also, found out my application and status have been deleted from Upstate's web site. That felt sort of unsettling you know kinda like one click of the mouse and I am gone. Oh well, SUNYs and I have a sordid history of unrequited love. I love 'em will all my heart and loins and they hate my guts. This is strangely similar to my love life but at least I didn't have to give the girls money.  <br/><br/>Tomorrow I have the last exam for this semester...can't believe it went by that fast. It seems like it was just yesterday that I was lost looking for the research building at G-Town and wound up in a garden full of naked statues. <br/><br/>December 14, 2006 - Today was the last exam for the SMP for this semester. I stayed up 'till 2 AM yesterday listening to lectures about tyrosine kinases. When I went to bed I couldn't sleep and kept mumbling 'phosphotyrosine kinase' and kept repeating the 'ras->raf->mek->MAPK' mantra for odd reason and wound up getting only about 30 minutes worth of sleep. So, by the time I went to take the exam, I was a bit out of it. I spent the first 10 minutes trying to find any resemblence between the stuff I studied and the questions on the exam. Eventually I settled by just writing everything I knew about a certain topic. For example, one questions asked to interpret the site of mutation on an immediate early response gene based on graphs. I couldn't for the life of me make heads or asses out of it and just wrote out everything I knew about that particular type of gene. It's glaringly obvious that my study strategy needs to change 'cause it ain't cutting the muster. <br/><br/>After one semester I learned a couple of things: (a) I am dumb, (b) I hate histology...questions and slides...everything looks like pink or blue circles to me, (c) med school stuff is tougher than anything I have encountered in college and working hard doesn't always give you the result you expect. But despite all these detriments, I still want to become a doctor so, you can add that I am brain-dead as well. I am heading to NY tomorrow and probably to Vermont later in the week. No, it's not an interview, I just wanted to go skiing. I really want to see if a person rolls down a snowy hill, will they actually make a snowball? These thoughts and tyrosines keep me up at night. Toodles.  <br/><br/>January 06, 2007 - Greetings true believers. New year, new slate and new everything....started off with a slew of bad news or should I say no news. No invites yet...possible interview pool crap at some and no rejections. This is my last year of trying to break into a US medical school. During the break, I fired off my application to SGU. I'll be one of the hordes of FMGs that you  all complaint about here and as such I guarantee that I will have a huge chip...nay a boulder on my shoulder (shit, that rhymes). <br/><br/>February 15, 2006 - Holy lack of updates, Batman! Nothing new, watching paint dry. Yup, about as fun as it sounds. SGU application has been received and is being reviewed. I researched a lot of the Carribean/Out-of-USA schools and SGU seems like the best bet. I have major issues with changes so, SGU facilities and dormitories seem decent. I really wouldn't want to worry about securing housing there. I am not applying to Ross or SABA or Hope Medical Schools. I am hopeful that SGU will take me. Oh yeah, Valentine's day sucks...I bought candy and I ate it myself. <br/><br/>February 27, 2006 - I have known fear and it is the mailman. I fear the mailman's blue jacket and the little carriage thingy he pushes around. I have dreams that the carriage has grown exponentially larger and is bearing down on me and spilling giant envelopes everywhere. In order to contine to instill fear in my heart, the mailman has brought bad news...this time it's Penn State. I really wanted a chance to interview there since it's in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Just the name of that location invokes imagery of copious amounts of chocolate bars being handed out at the interview. Only one day left in February and I haven't heard a peep from the schools.<br/><br/>March 05, 2007 - Good news - VCU updated my status page, bad news - it don't mean squat. It says:<br/> <br/>'The committee's file review indicates that they would like to consider your file further. We are now in the process of scheduling interviews and will continue to do so through February. Unfortunately, the committee indicates interest in far more candidates than we are able to interview. Since we are dependent on the Committee member's schedules for interview spaces, we are unable to predict when or if we will be able to schedule you this year. Please continue to check this site to learn when further action has been taken.'<br/><br/>Oh also, I am on hold for grades. Yayyyy! <br/><br/>From my experience, this simply seems like a long, dragged out wait to the bitter-end. I actuially want to get a nice, straight-forward rejection at this point. It's March and I have ZERO interviews. At least last year, at this time, I had 2. My application cycle blows as hard as a three dollar hooker.   <br/><br/>Update - Invite from Wayne State - (insert happy face) : ) <br/><br/>March 14, 2007 - Ignore 'continued interest message' from VCU...at least that's what it said on the applicant status home page:<br/>03/12/2007 <br/>Our interview slots were completely filled. The Admissions committee wanted to interview many more candidates than we had space to accomodate. For those of you awaiting response for interview, please note that the system automatically may send you a message of our continued interest in your application. Please ignore the automatated message. We are currently preparing a message to acknowledge the end of our interview season. We thank you for your interest in our school. Contact your premedical advisor on how to increase the strength of your application if you plan to apply this summer. Early applications are recommended as the number of <br/>applications to medical schools is on the rise. <br/><br/>Also, got an e-mail from SUNY Buffalo and it's an 'intermediate' pool thingy. It was:<br/><br/>Dear Candidate:<br/><br/>Your application has been reviewed and evaluated by our Committee, and a decision has been made to place your application in our 'Intermediate' pool.  As the year progresses, and we can further evaluate our applicant pool, 'Intermediates' will either move up into our 'Invite for Interview' group or down to our 'Reject' group.  <br/>     It will NOT be necessary for you to communicate with us, as we will automatically reevaluate your application at scheduled intervals and compare it to our constantly changing pool.  Submission of additional material will NOT impact the decision-making process.<br/>     I appreciate your patience and understanding in this matter.<br/><br/><br/>Last three times I applied I never got one of these. It sounds like a pre-int waitlist. That's another school that leaves me twisting in the wind. In my days, applicants received closure ASAP...we either want you or we don't. But nowasays, these kids with their Rock 'n Roll music and piercings and Samuel L. Jackson movies talking about putting applicants on a waitlist for interview. If there was ever such a thing it'd be a crime against nature. Also found out that St George let's you do the first basic science year in London...crikey...wait that's wrong...Blimey! Also researching about Detroit and found out some informational nuggets: (a)Robocop is from Detroit and (b) my favorite TV judge, Judge Mathis is from Detroit. Watch this space for more informational nuggets.   <br/>               <br/>Update 2: It's official....I suck. I had doubts before but it's been unarguably confirmed. Got a nice PDF rejection from Wake Forest. I really liked Wake and thought I'd have a chance considering they really screen the secondaries. <br/>                               <br/>March 20, 2007 - I am updating just for the sake of updating. No new news other than there are 5 schools left on my list. I am nervous about my interview and feel like my gut is going to plummet down my ass. I've been asking around fellow SDNers for advice on Wayne State. I wanna give a shout out to my peep Sony AKA YankeeKanuck for his very detialed and helpeful advice regarding Wayne State..muchos gracias. SGU has received all the necessary documentation and is in the process of reviewing it. Hopefully, I hear from them soon. That's it for now. Toodles. <br/><br/>March 24, 2007 - Got an e-mail status notification from VCU and yeah, it's a rejection. It was nicely worded. Went to a med school party last night and although it was kinda awkward for me at first, I had fun. I played a mean gave of 'UNO'. I cheated like a bitch though, so, that's right, I can't be honest at card games, even at Uno. Psyched for Wayne State and had a mock interview with a friend. It went well but I have this face where if I get stumped, I look like a deer caught in a headlight with their pants down, so, I need to have a better poker face. I read up on Wayne and it seems like a really good fit for me and I'm not just saying that. I love the location which makes for great exposure, great opportunities for residency, great curriculum and P/F classes. The faculty is active in the community as well. I am just worried about the low percentage on OOS that they accept. But since, I made it to the interview stage, hopefully they like what they saw and are interested.  <br/><br/>April 3, 2007 - It's official...I am SUNY's ugly, red-headed stepchild with a third nipple. Buffalo sent me a rejection today after placing me on the intermediate pool. I guess I was on the shallow end of that pool (rim shot). Psyched for my interview at Wayne. The more I learn about this school, the more I fall in love with it. It is a love story between a man-child and a medical institution. Got 4 more schools left on my list...at 2 of them (NYMC and Temple) I have no chance. I still haven't received my rejection notice from NYMC for the 2006 cycle, you'd think a $100 would get me a notice or something. I am hoping for some love from Drexel. But it seems like they are nearly done interviewing, same thing with UMDNJ-NJMS. Oh well, another year and I am a couple of thousand dollars poorer.   <br/><br/>April 11, 2007 - Had my interview at Wayne. I have known true love and thy name is Wayne State. Wayne is one of the best kept secrets as far as med school goes...because you can only experience it's awesomeness only if you are physically there. I will know my fate  by April 25, 2007 after 1:00PM. The countdown has begun, starting...NOW!!! <br/><br/>April 15, 2007 - 10 days left till the dreaded call in date at Wayne. I keep playing different scenerios in my head. One of them goes: 'After careful review, the committee has decided that your file is no longer under consideration'. Another goes: 'After careful review, the committee has decided to place your file in the alternate list..you might get off, you might not, have fun biyatch'. And you all can guess the unlikely last scenerio. I need to stop thinking about this. The more I go back to the interview date and the more I analyze it, the more I become critical of my interview. I coulda said more, clarified certain things, worn a different shoe, had a windsor knot at my tie instead of the knot I use to tie my shoelaces...stuff like that. I am losing it man! Three schools left on the list: Drexel, Temple and NYMC. No offense to NYMC students or the institution itself but their admissions office sucks ass big time. I will mention for the umpteenth time that I never got a rejection notice from them last year and this year they're sticking with their MO and being totally incommunicado. Anyways, that's all the 98% rant and 2% info.  <br/><br/>April 25. 2007 - Today is the creaded call-in date at Wayne. I've been shitting bricks at the thought of it since Monday. I am inclined to not call today and find out my fate via snail mail a week or two later. I talked to my dad this morning and he said to call in. His logic is that today or 2 weeks later, the decision will stay the same. But that doesn't mean that I will stop being nervous. I keep thinking about my interview and analyzing it...so many things were left unsaid. I think about what the decision might be and then I just feel my body going cold...sorta numb from the neck down and then I have this serious urge to vomit...yes, vomit due to sheer terror. Anyways, I'll update when/if I can wrangle up the courage to call in. <br/><br/>Update: It's a waitlist. Can't catch a motherlovin' break. <br/>This unofficially marks the end of this year's cycle. Perhaps I was not meant to go to med school in the U.S. but I can at least bow out saying that I gave it all. I usually don't believe in predestination and stuff like that, but at this point, I have been hogtied and destiny is treating me like it's bitch. After 3 MCATs, 4 application cycles, no one can say that I didn't try. I liked Wayne. I would love to have gone there. But they have 20% OOS acceptance rate and better people than I are on their waitlist, so I will not be holding my breath. <br/><br/>May 15, 2007 - It's that time of the year again, when accepted students profess their love for the special school and alternate list students find true love at their waitlisted school. Seems very similar to spring time and Valentine's Day. Anyways, not much to report other than the fact that I am still on Wayne's waitlist. I called up SGU and they are still reviewing my application. I am all set to go on a trip to Dubai. If I have to go to the Carribeans, I might as well enjoy the time I have left on my hands. <br/><br/>May 16, 2007 - My application to SGU was deemed complete this morning and I got an interview at 3:00 PM...talk about fast turn around time. They will contact me with the exact date in a few weeks. It's bittersweet. <br/><br/>June 10, 2007 - Wayne State has had NO movement and are not planning on having any this year. I have the reverse of Midas touch...whatever waitlist I touch turns to shit. This waitlist seems to be mirroring SLU waitlist from last year. I don't understand how an school overaccepts and then also manages to form a waitlist. It just defies logic. Think about it....we accept 150 extra kids and then also make a waitlist of about 200 other people. Do you really need a waitlist after all? At this point, I am hoping I get some sort of closure from them by July. Apparently, they have been thinning the herd so to speak and rejected a buncha good people of the waitlist. <br/><br/>At any rate, plan B is moving along nicely. Have my interview with SGU coming up this Thursday. Read up on the website and stuff...seems nice enough. I used to be worried about the weather but after spending a week in Saudi Arabia at 115+ degrees, I am used to the warmth.  <br/><br/>June 20, 2007 - Third time's the charm. I finally had my interview for St. George's. I showed up to the clinic last week but the interviewer got caught in a meeting so no show. And yesterday, as I was about to leave got a call that the interviewer was scheduled for a surgery. So today with much apprehension and through more traffic, went to LIC Hospital and had my interview. The guy was very enthusiastic and really sold the school. Since he's a graduate, he knows what he's talking about. He said he'll send in his recommendation tonight and I can call next week for a decision. Plan B seems to be progressing nicely.<br/><br/>Wayne State has adopted a vow of silence. I called last week and apprently there have been no movement. This year's waitlist sucks. Anyways, I am bowing out from U.S. allopathic school. It was a bastard of a dream.<br/><br/>July 30, 2007 - Holy lack of updates Batman!!! Well, there have been no updates because there have been nothing worth updating. Today was the first day of orientation at Wayne and guess yours truly is not invited to the party. After 4 years, I still can't shake the 'always a bridesmaid but never a bride' feeling. Hell, I can't even catch the motherlovin' bouquet. My interview at Wayne was in my opinion, the best of the interviews I had in the last two years. Before you back flip into my throat and say 'if it went so well, why didn't you get in?', I have to let you know why I think this way. My interviewer was Dr. Thomas and at the end of the interview he told me 'I don't see any problems' and then went on to clarify all the stuff they look at and how I meet the requirement. Also, the interview was very conversational and went both ways. At any rate, apparently the Adcoms did in fact find something wrong. Oh well, I'm happy to have had the opportunity to interview there.  <br/><br/>At any rate, I am starting at SGU in January 'cause they don't have space for August class. I didn't want time off but it's sort of being forced on me. I chalk it up to the grand plan that God has devised to give the cosmic finger to my dream. After four years, it is crystal clear that I have sucked more than a fair share of monkey balls.  <br/>   </p>
