I'm pretty certain that this evaluation was strong.<br/><br/>-Letter from the professor I did SI for<br/><br/>I'm pretty certain this letter was very strong.<br/><br/>-Letter from the PI I did research under at SURF<br/><br/>I'm pretty certain this letter was very strong.</div><br/><br/><h1>About This Profile</h1><div class="paul411activitysection" id="paul411">I have included as much information as I possibly could about me and my application cycle in order to help out future applicants. The descriptions I've provided in the activities section are the verbatim descriptions I used in my AMCAS. I've also provided my personal statement below and, finally, some information on my MCAT study plan.<br/><br/>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE DELVING INTO THE INFORMATION:<br/><br/>-As this profile gets older, it will become more and more obsolete. Already it's slightly out of date because of the change in how AMCAS is dealing with activities (i.e., choosing important activities and allowing only shorter descriptions in other activities) and it will continue to become even more so with time. That said, make sure you're using strategies and tips that are pertinent for the year YOU'RE applying in.<br/><br/>-Absolutely under no circumstances should you copy any portion of my personal statement. This should go without saying, but nothing would surprise me at this point. The personal statement is just that: personal. I answered the question the best way that I could using the activities and experiences that were most important to me. The personal statement you create should reflect your own writing style, method of answering the question, and activities that are most important to you. If you need help with your PS, I'd recommend using SDN's PS reader service that starts up each summer.<br/><br/>-If you found this profile at all useful, do the SDN community a service and create a detailed, well-maintained MDApps when you get around to applying. As I'm sure you've noticed, there are many, many MDApps that are absolutely useless because people provide almost no information in them or stop updating them halfway through the cycle. If you don't want to keep it updated during the cycle, then at least create one after your cycle is finished. I found the rare fully-completed MDApps to be extremely helpful, and you can ensure that this resource is available to future applicants by creating your own profile.<br/><br/>-A post that I made in the pre-allo forum discussing my thoughts and observations on the admissions process and tips for future applicants was ultimately turned into an article for SDN. That article best represents what is my advice for future applicants; most of the advice is general and will hopefully be helpful for many cycles to come. I seldom check the discussion section of my MDApps and because I receive a pretty large volume of PMs on SDN I rarely check those as well; as a result, I usually don't respond to requests for advice or questions on the cycle. That's what SDN is for, and I encourage you to utilize and contribute to that community. You can find the article here: http://www.studentdoctor.net/2011/06/reflections-on-the-medical-admissions-process/<br/><br/>-If you have a MDApps and want to make it cool with all of these additional sections and the activity boxes, visit paul411's MDApps <a href="http://www.mdapplicants.com/profile.php?id=20784">here</a> for a link to a tool to generate the code necessary for these add-ons.<br/><br/>Best of luck!</div><br/><br/><h1>Activities</h1> * <a style="font-weight:bold" onclick="$$('.paul411activitydescription').invoke('show')" href="javascript:void(0)">Click here to show all activity descriptions</a> or you can view activity descriptions one-by-one (click on activity title).<div class="paul411activitysection"><h3>Research Activities</h3><div class="paul411activity"> <a class="paul411activitytitle arrow" onclick="event.srcElement.nextSibling.toggle();event.srcElement.toggleClassName('expanded');event.srcElement.nextSibling.toggleClassName('paul411visible')" href="javascript:void(0)">UTSW Summer Research Undergraduate Fellowship </a><div style="display:none" class="paul411activitydescription">Summer 2008, Summer 2009<br/><br/>During my two stints with the UTSW SURF program, I worked with Dr. David Farrar in the Department of Immunology researching the development and differentiation of CD8+ T cells. During the first summer, I investigated the differentiation pathways in human cells in vitro; the following summer I focused on those same pathways in murine cells in vitro. Each summer included a poster session for the UTSW students and faculty. <br/><br/>Though I began working under a graduate student, I was eventually given the opportunity to work independently, including in some experimental design and data analysis. The work I helped with was included in a publication, and one figure was data from an experiment I designed, ran, and analyzed (see below for citation). The majority of my work during the second summer was done independently with guidance from a graduate student when needed.

Leaders must attend all class lectures, create original teaching materials, and lead at least two sessions per week; students who regularly attend my sessions complete the course with a course GPA 0.5-1.0 points higher than non-attendees despite lower standardized test scores. I also frequently meet with individuals outside of the scheduled sessions to answer more specific and individualized questions, a significant commitment beyond the stated responsibilities of the position. I am responsible for about 300 students in the fall and 100 in the spring. <br/><br/>In addition to performing these functions, I also strive to be a mentor to younger students, especially freshmen, who are often anxious about finally embarking on their collegiate experience. Whether it be offering advice on professors, courses to take, or the pre-med process in general - a popular topic - I try to make myself as useful as possible to those I interact with, especially with respect to topics other than chemistry. <br/><br/>I have led sessions primarily for the two introductory chemistry courses, but I also led sessions for an introductory biology course in the fall of 2008.

As a member of the Student Recruitment (SR) committee, I traveled across the state to attend college fairs and other recruiting events. SR members are required to go on two trips in the fall and have lunch with visiting prospective students and their families in the spring. Over the course of the year, I went on five recruiting trips to the Dallas/Ft.

I began to take seriously the need to get in shape and developed a diet and exercise plan to do so. Over the next several months I lost over 50 pounds and developed a true appreciation for running and weightlifting. On Valentine's Day of this year, just shy of a year after I began my weight loss initiative, I completed the Austin Half-Marathon with a time in the top third of all finishers.

I became familiar with the medical profession in a profoundly personal way when he was diagnosed with a double herniation of the spine that left him completely debilitated and immobilized and me heartbroken and helpless. He recovered within a few months after medical treatment, but the episode catalyzed a strong interest in the medical profession that has continued to grow since. In the course of my undergraduate experiences, this initial curiosity became an immutable desire to become a medical professional, and I eventually realized that serving as a physician would be personally gratifying and professionally fulfilling in a way no other profession could be.<br/><br/>As a student, I have spent the majority of my time at Baylor comprehending, analyzing, and synthesizing the information from my courses. Spending time in lecture and studying for exams became more than a means to achieving a certain grade in a course: it satisfied that desire to understand and know a concept if only for the sake of knowing. My academic achievements are the result of an innate curiosity that stems from constantly seeking to discover how and why our world functions the way it does. The incredible complexity and elegance of living systems specifically form the heart of that intrigue. Moving from content mastery in the classroom to scientific discovery in the lab built an even greater personal appreciation for scholastic excellence, and the importance of choosing an intellectually challenging career grounded in the biomedical sciences immediately became evident.<br/><br/>Working with others on campus and in the community to substantively improve the condition of those less fortunate has also played a definitive role in my decision to enter the medical profession. My service endeavors have provided the opportunity to experience not only the personal satisfaction of giving of myself but also the clear and visible impact my work makes on those it serves. There is an immediate sense of fulfillment that comes with doing a good deed that has perpetuated my desire to serve, but more important is the effect of enabling others to take advantage of opportunities in their lives they otherwise may be unable to. Spending two hours each week at Habitat Re-Store to make building Habitat houses possible, for example, is well worth the life-changing opportunity for a stranger to have a place to call home. On a larger scale, donating my time and skills to better the life of my fellow man and leading others to do the same has become a personal duty to my peers rather than something done solely for enjoyment. This realization made entering a profession that focuses on building relationships and genuinely improving the quality of life of others absolutely imperative.<br/><br/>My medical experiences directly appealed to these personal insights and confirmed my decision to become a physician. I saw the center-stage roles those values -- a love for learning, an inclination to lead, and an obligation to serve -- held in a physician's daily work. The technical and intellectual ability involved in making sound clinical judgments despite a fast-paced and often chaotic environment highlighted the importance of knowledge-based decisions and lifelong learning in medicine. The role of the physician in leading a medical team and shouldering the responsibility for a patient's well-being throughout a case made clear the import of desiring and being capable of fulfilling leadership roles. Of paramount significance, though, was the effect of the physician's work on his patients and his obligation to serve them. Seeing the immediate relief on a teenage girl's face after having her bandages removed from a third-degree burn demonstrated the incredible power the physician has to comfort, reassure, and heal his patient through clinical ability and genuine compassion. Experiences like these revealed the extensive overlap between my personal goals and those of doctors, and rather than discovering that the medical profession required certain attributes and seeking to develop those skills and strengths, I realized that becoming a physician would allow me to incorporate the values and beliefs I already hold to be important into my future professional life.<br/><br/>While my father did not require enduring medical supervision for his injury, I have seen and interacted with others who do require the constant attention of health professionals for their daily needs. Patients expect a physician whose biomedical knowledge is informed by a dedication to improving their immediate physical well-being and long-term quality of life rather than just an expert in clinical science. The call to care for these individuals in their most vulnerable moments has proven overpowering, and firsthand experience in healthcare settings along with my other activities has strengthened that calling. Though the road to becoming a practitioner of medicine is lengthy, difficult, and indisputably trying, my experiences have assured me of my choice, and I can imagine no greater achievement than dedicating my life to alleviating the suffering that accompanies human disease by becoming a physician.</div><br/><br/><h1>MCAT Information</h1><div class="paul411activitysection" id="paul411">I've attached the exact syllabus/schedule that I used for my MCAT studying to this post in the 30+ Study Tips thread:<br/>http://forums.studentdoctor.net/showpost.php?p=10501784&postcount=821.<br/><br/>As I note in that post, I stopped using the Kaplan book pretty early on in the process (probably after the first week or two) and simply went over the EK lecture on the second day that was originally for Kaplan reviews.<br/><br/>I found the combination of EK and Kaplan to be pretty great for self-study. EK is definitely NOT designed for people that need to be taught the material rather than simply review the material. It's too concise to serve as a primary teaching guide. If you think you might need a teaching guide, however, I'd recommend Kaplan's Premier Program book, which provides a lot more detail and instruction than EK. I used it as an occasional reference for topics where EK fell short.<br/><br/>If you're disciplined and/or strapped for cash, hopefully my story will demonstrate that you don't have to take a course costing thousands of dollars in order to do well. The key to succeeding with a self-study plan, however, is 1) creating a detailed, DAILY plan and 2) prioritizing your activities and other commitments such that you can stick to the schedule you come up with. If you don't think you can do #1 and #2, a more professionally structured course might be the way you want to go. <br/><br/>Here are the EK materials that I used:<br/>http://www.amazon.com/Examkrackers-Complete-MCAT-Study-Pkg/dp/1893858499/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1310678210&sr=8-1<br/><br/>And here's the Kaplan Premier Program:<br/>http://www.amazon.com/Kaplan-MCAT-2009-2010-Premier-Program/dp/1419552724/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1310678243&sr=1-2 (note that Kaplan produces a new book each year;

			<h2 style="padding-top: 15px;">Summary of Application Experience</h2>

			<p>KEY FOR THE ABOVE ABBREVIATIONS:<br/><br/>SR = secondary received<br/>SS = secondary submitted<br/>C = complete (secondary received + LORs received)<br/>II = interview invite<br/>IA = interview attended<br/>WL = waitlisted<br/>A = accepted<br/>W = withdrew<br/>R = rejected<br/><br/>==========================<br/><br/>Expecting nothing, shooting for the stars. We'll see what happens.<br/><br/>==========================<br/><br/>SCHOOL IMPRESSIONS:<br/><br/>UT San Antonio (interview date: 8/30/2010)<br/>PROS: faculty and students were extremely nice and appreciative of our presence, students seemed very happy and relaxed, every student that I talked to emphasized the camaraderie of the class and trying to work through the med school grindfest as a group rather than as a set of competitive individuals, and organ systems curriculum<br/><br/>CONS: facilities (they're quite old) and San Antonio (not too excited about going to yet another city that "grows on you")<br/><br/>Overall, the experience here was pretty enjoyable. My first interview ever was with the Dean of Admissions (yikes), so that was a pretty intimidating way to start off the cycle. The interviews were fairly straightforward and essentially consisted of asking about the stuff on my PS and supplemental essay(s).I was pleasantly surprised with UTSA and have moved it off the "not even considering" list to the "a possibility" list.<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/><br/>UT Houston (interview date: 9/3/2010)<br/>PROS: Texas Medical Center (this is pretty much any health professional's version of a candy store), the area TCM is in and the Houston area in general, great faculty and students (got a fairly chill vibe here as well), great price, and the facilities are incredible<br/><br/>CONS: No significant cons<br/><br/>The whole process at UTH was incredible. The social the night before was a ton of fun, the tour was great and informative, albeit a bit long, and both interviews were enjoyable. Texas Medical Center alone is an incredible asset, not to mention that UTH has access to MD Anderson. What a great school. I can 100% see myself here and not have any problems with it.<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/><br/>Vandy (interview date: 9/7/2010)<br/>PROS: Centralized facilities (no traveling for rotations!), students are EXTREMELY happy - you can tell they enjoy their time at Vandy, the Nashville area, stipend for summer research after M1, and the "emphasis project"<br/><br/>CONS: None<br/><br/>Surprisingly, I was a little disappointed in the interview day (not the school itself). The tours weren't very helpful; we never even went into University Hospital, the main teaching hospital, or any of their clinical facilities for that matter. Lunch was ok. The highlight of the day was the students and their enthusiasm for recruiting for the school. The administration clearly does everything it can to keep its students happy. I know I would be happy here if I went here and, judging by their match lists, get a pretty incredible education. Vandy definitely still remains in my top 3.<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/><br/>UT Southwestern (interview date: 9/11/2010)<br/>PROS: Research-oriented institution, main teaching hospital is a county hospital, significant autonomy in MS3/MS4 years, familiar with the Dallas area<br/><br/>CONS: Weird curriculum, students have a reputation for being gunners (though this seems to have changed with a change in their grading system)<br/><br/>I thought the admissions staff did a great job on both the pre-interview information day and the interview day. Everything was well organized and very informative, if not a little lengthy. The clinical facilities aren't as extensive as UTH's, but all of the students seem to be impressed with their clinical experiences. I was surprised at the overall demeanor of the students; they have a reputation of being intense - and I definitely saw that in the MS3s and MS4s - but the younger students seem much happier and more personable. The choice between UTH and UTSW, if that choice exists, will be a difficult one.<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/><br/>University of Chicago (interview date: 9/28/2010)<br/>PROS: Enthusiastic, relaxed students; the administration clearly values diversity in its class and the interdisciplinary approach of the university; really enjoyed the campus and what I saw of Chicago; small class size; great research opportunities for med students<br/><br/>CONS: Cost ($300k+ for four years?!)<br/><br/>I was EXTREMELY impressed with Chicago's interview day. The interviewers were extremely friendly and conversational, and all the students I talked to were pretty laid back. Pursuit of joint degrees is possible (including M. Ed.) and seems to be taken advantage of by a good chunk of the students. I'm really hoping to get an acceptance and go back for a second look. I definitely didn't expect to be this impressed with the school. Based solely on what I've seen thus far at interviews, this would be my top choice.<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/><br/>University of Michigan (interview date: 10/1/2010)<br/>PROS: Loved the curriculum (one class at a time, flexible quiz/test times), Ann Arbor is a pretty cool city, great reputation amongst residency programs, fairly cheap housing prices<br/><br/>CONS: None<br/><br/>Overall, I was pretty impressed with Michigan. Students were fun, the admissions staff was fantastic, and the facilities (or what I saw of them) seemed great. Ann Arbor seems like an awesome city: very college town-like, and the entire downtown area seems to be catered to intellectual-type people (I'm guessing that has something to do with all of the incredible programs Michigan has going for it). I got weird vibes while I was there, but I think that's more because I was tired than anything else. I hope I'm invited to the Second Look weekend; I would love to see Michigan again when I'm not as tired and run down.<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/><br/>WashU (interview date: 10/12/2010)<br/>PROS: Great research opportunities, absolutely fantastic facilities, low cost of living (relatively)<br/><br/>CONS: Didn't get a good vibe from the students, seems extremely research-focused<br/><br/>I'm not sure how I felt about WashU. It's clear that the opportunities here are truly unique, and the level of education and opportunities for research couldn't be better. But I got the feeling that the students were very research/career focused rather than focused on healing people, and even though the two are strongly related, I definitely think there's a difference that shapes an individual's philosophy of medicine. I hope that I get a chance to visit the campus again to get a batter idea of whether this was a fluke or not.<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/><br/>Baylor (interview date: 10/15/2010)<br/>PROS: Systems-based curriculum, 1.5- vs. 2-year curriculum, TMC, plenty of research opportunities, great value (cost is comparable to the UT system)<br/><br/>CONS: None<br/><br/>I was much more impressed with Baylor than I thought I would be. The students seemed very happy, the resources available were incredible, and the more I learned, the more I liked. The curriculum is particularly unique and very desirable. As was mentioned with UTH, the clinical/research opportunities available at TMC are simply incomparable. No other institution is going to have a similar breadth of facilities available in such a small area. Combined with the relatively low price, Baylor becomes a pretty tempting option. If I was accepted to all of the Texas schools, this would very likely be my first in-state choice (even over UTSW).<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/><br/>Mayo (interview date: 10/25/2010)<br/>PROS: Curriculum (block schedule, selectives, choice in vacation time, "breaks" of sorts after every block, true P/F for pre-clinical years), ability to seek second degrees from any institution in the nation (AWESOME), super small class size, students are awesome, faculty emphasis on teaching, Rochester is a gorgeous area, very low cost of living, generous living costs calculated by the financial aid office, half scholarship for all students, grants for students pursuing second degrees<br/><br/>CONS: Rochester doesn't have much going on (but the Twin Cities are nearby, and the camaraderie of the class seems to more than make up for a slow city life), mandatory class attendance<br/><br/>Wow - what an incredible place. The students were fantastic, the clinical facilities incredible... everything was fantastic. The only potential downside is Rochester, but it seems like a great place to be, and you can't complain about the low cost of living. This is my top choice by far, and I don't really see that changing. I would almost certainly matriculate here if accepted. This place seems to offer everything I'm looking for in terms of educational opportunities and personal considerations.<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/><br/>Hopkins (interview date: 11/4/2010)<br/>PROS: Other than it's THE Johns Hopkins school of medicine, I'm not really sure, their brand new, $60 million education building is pretty incredible, fantastic opportunities to do research<br/><br/>CONS: Expensive with no merit aid, the surrounding area is literally housing projects<br/><br/>I was fairly underwhelmed with Hopkins. I didn't really see why it has such a fantastic reputation. That doesn't at all mean that the school is undeserving of its reputation, but the interview day certainly didn't attempt to convince anyone why they're awesome. I guess they feel like they don't have to. On the positive side, even though JHU is obviously research-focused, I didn't get the same feel that I did when I was at WashU. There's definitely a very strong clinical focus in addition to research. I think this would be a great place to train - I'm sure the reputation is based on something - but I'm not really sure why, other than that it "is."<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/><br/>Columbia (interview date: 12/14/2010)<br/>PROS: New York!, abbreviated curriculum (1.5 years pre-clinical), Step 1 is taken after the third year<br/><br/>CONS: Cost (in all aspects - tuition, cost of living, etc.), when I asked the dean of admissions (my interviewer) about doing M.D./Ed.D., he seemed not very enthusiastic and indirectly discouraging<br/><br/>Overall, I was impressed with Columbia and liked the feeling that I got here. The students seemed relaxed and normal, there's a big emphasis on extracurricular involvement and a holistic view of medical training, and New York is fantastic. For whatever reason, I didn't quite get the drop-dead-in-love feeling, but I did like it. The cost is a bit of a turn-off...<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/><br/>Cornell (interview date: 12/15/2010)<br/>PROS: Love the area of NY the campus is in, fantastic housing for students, great facilities all around (you can tell this is an affluent area), like the importance of PBL in the curriculum, plenty of opportunities (and fully funded) for travel around the globe, somewhat generous financial aid, classes end every day at 1pm<br/><br/>CONS: Especially high cost-of-living due to the Upper East Side community, internal rankings for grades (wtf?), high sticker price, virtually no multi-institutional training opportunities (i.e., M.Ed./Ed.D.)<br/><br/>I actually enjoyed Cornell quite a bit; I would even say more than Columbia, though there are a couple of fairly large issues that would require some sacrifice. I loved the community Cornell is in, and I really like that all of the facilities are very close together. That would definitely make for less painful walks during the winter. The apparent lack of dual-degree programs is a little irritating, though, and I think would probably be a deal-breaker. That the school internally ranks students (albeit into quartiles) during the pre-clinical years is also pretty irritating. That said, I got the vibe that students really enjoy their time at Cornell: the curriculum and schedule afford them plenty of opportunities to be normal people, and the emphasis on self-directed learning means people choose to study as much as I want. I'm just not sure if Cornell offers the opportunities that I'm looking for.<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/><br/>Yale (interview date: 2/9/2011)<br/>PROS: The Yale System (no grades, no rankings, no mandatory class attendance... awesome)<br/><br/>CONS: Cost, didn't really like New Haven all that much (it's hard to see myself living there)<br/><br/>I enjoyed Yale, but I'm not sure if it quite made the jump up to the top for me like I expected. Like Columbia, I didn't necessarily DISLIKE anything, but I also didn't fall immediately in love either. We'll see - if I get accepted, it would likely be a serious contender. If I get rejected, I don't think I'll be losing any sleep over it. I think the main problem is seeing myself in New Haven; I don't feel like this is a place I would necessarily love to live in. But I LOVE the idea of the Yale system, and I definitely think I would flourish in that kind of environment.</p>
