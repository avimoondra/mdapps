I withdrew my application without submitting a secondary via email, politely thanking them for their time, and apologizing for any inconvenience. I really hope this choice doesn't turn around to bite me later. <br/>UPDATE LATER IN THE DAY: An adcom emailed me back, succinctly and politely saying "thanks for telling us, your app has been withdrawn." I'm slowly letting out the breath that I've been holding, and deciding that perhaps it's not such a big deal that I withdrew pre-secondary completion (although I still don't recommend it).<br/><br/>Secondary Received 7/30.</p>

					<p>Rejected via email: Rejected w/out a request for my LOR. This one surprises me a little; I'm not shocked at a rejection; far from it. I expect to be rejected plenty! The concern I have is that it looks as though I got screened out pretty early in the process (i.e. based on the lack of a LOR request), which is obviously worrisome. Mayo was not one of my TOP CHOICE schools, per se, but I would have been very, very pleased to go there.

					<b>Summary of Experience:</b>
					<p>Rejected via email: Disappointed, but even if they had invited me to interview at this point I doubt I would have attended. It's a bummer, but life goes on. I really don't know what Stanford looks for in applicants/didn't like about my application, but if they think we're incompatible then who am I to disagree?<br/><br/>Silence Update: It is exactly four months to the day since I was marked complete at Stanford. I have not heard a word since. Let this be a lesson to others: do everything you can to avoid having a "top choice" school before interviews. Stanford, for various reasons, was my top choice. And, as a result, despite receiving interviews from schools I never dreamt I'd get to visit, I am pretty sad/disappointed about the silence. So my advice to others: definitely synthesize your list of "tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3" schools, but avoid getting overly attached to any single institution until you at least get to visit. I know that they might not have officially stamped "reject" on my file yet; but with each day that passes, my chances (and, collaterally, my hopes) dwindle smaller and smaller.<br/><br/>Secondary Received 7/10.</p>

					<b>Summary of Experience:</b>
					<p><b>Rejected via Status Update:</b> Honestly, this stings quite a bit. It hasn't been a very good day for the wolverine (both as far as the app cycle is concerned and in "real life"). At least I can make peace with the fact that my cycle is practically complete.<br/><br/>Update/Interest Letter Sent in January<br/><br/>Post-Interview Reaction (Early October):<br/>When I first synthesized a list of medical schools to apply to, UPenn was not on the list. I�d never really heard of it before, after all. Then, after one or two revisions, I added UPenn because my stats �fit� the school, and I noticed that they received an extraordinary amount of money in research funding. It wasn�t until I was actually writing my secondaries for this program that I realized the caliber of this institution. I�ll get into my reasons for saying this in a bit� <br/><br/>To say that I enjoyed my interview day here would be an understatement. With one or two exceptions, I don�t think I�ve connected with a set of students, interviewees, and faculty as well as I did here. Everyone was energetic, enthusiastic, motivated, and passionate. The M4s that met with us spoke in double time, rapidly firing off lists of reasons why Perelman is amazing, with such candid enthusiasm and candor that I couldn�t help but feel infected. But I�m getting ahead of myself.<br/><br/>I stayed in the Holiday Inn near the Stadiums. Highly recommend: the staff was friendly, the room was exceedingly comfortable, amenties were amenable, and food was delicious. In the morning, the admissions office was terribly easy to find; the directions posted on my interview page on the application website were very easy to follow. As a result, I was actually quite early to my interview, but no matter. I enjoyed a (second) continental breakfast with a very friendly and engaging cohort of interviewees. Afterwards, we were thoroughly entertained with a stimulating, informative, and casual orientation to the program, it�s curriculum, research opportunities, etc. <br/><br/>Then we attended a small-group learning sessions. This isn�t the first small group session I�ve attended, but it was by far the most enjoyable.  I understand that medical school is a stressful, sleepless maelstrom of material. So I totally get it when students show up to lecture or group work looking tired and apprehensive. I empathize. But here, at Perelman, the room was loud. Students energetically gesticulated at the beautiful technology, arguing over answer choices and enthusiastically debating implications of inferences. Here, I thought, was a place where my boundless energy and enthusiasm might not be an outlier. Could it be possible that I�ve found my people? My fellow energizer bunnies?<br/><br/>Later in the day, we received a tour of the facilities. If you didn�t know, then let me be the first to inform you: Perelman is gorgeous. The hospitals are gorgeous. The classrooms utilize state-of-the-art technology. The sim center is as good as any, and better than most. And, best of all, they�re opening a brand. new. building. for students in 2015. While they�re not offering real tours yet, they have plenty of promotional videos plastered all over their website. And why wouldn�t they; if you have something that incredible to show off, wouldn't you? Seriously, go look these videos up. My only concern is that I�d be so distracted by the general beauty that I wouldn't be able to focus on memorizing, say, histological concepts.<br/><br/>The interviews were casual. Faculty and students alike made it clear that they were no longer �screening� people out; if you make it to interview day, you�ve survived that kind of process. Now, during interview day, everything is really just about assessing fit. Are you energetic? Do you fit the Perelman philosophy? As (almost) always, I felt confident about my interviews, although I may have babbled a bit out of nervousness. I guess I�ll have to wait until March to see what UPenn thinks of me.<br/><br/>P.S. Couple quick bullet points worth noting:<br/>- True pass/fail ungraded system only lasts for the first 6 months. After that, it�s H/P/F. Then, in clerkships, its H/HP/P/F. It also sounded as though the school does keep some records for ranking students, although they didn�t appear to have hard-set percentile ranges. <br/>- Many, many students pursue a master�s degree or take an additional year of research.<br/>- Philadelphia is an amazing place to live. The culture is abundant, from sports to theater to music. Most people, students included, are able to bike to everything, included clerkships at hospitals other than HUP. So that�s a major perk. <br/>- The match list is very impressive, although surprisingly few went into my specialty of choice (although many, many people went into anesthesiology and derm and ortho, so clearly it�s no fault of the institution's).<br/><br/>II Update: I was having a terrible day today. Until Perelman decided to put a gigantic smile on my face.<br/><br/>Secondary Received 7/1.</p>

					<b>Summary of Experience:</b>
					<p>Withdrew after Duke Second Look (and forgot to Update). Would not attend over Duke.<br/><br/>Post-Interview Reaction (Early October): <br/>It is so nice to have such a fantastic housing setup for interviewers. The fact that WashU essentially has �hotel rooms� in Olin Hall set aside for interviewers is emblematic of one of the themes repeated throughout the day: WashU cares about its students. As a premier teaching, academic, and research institution, WashU has an extra vested interest in the success of their students. At other institutions, this kind of interest might come at the loss of some patient-centered care, but that doesn�t appear to happen here. The two hospitals affiliated with WashU (B-Js and the Children�s) are consistently lauded as two of the best in the entire Midwest (no disrespect to Chicago or Ann Arbor). <br/><br/>The second theme that ran throughout the day was the justification of the graded system during M2. WashU faculty pronounce their system as �traditional and cautious about adopting change too rapidly.� Although they concede that they will probably shift towards a P/F system for M2 within the next few years, the avid adherence to 2-year preclinical appears unwavering. This is either a bad thing, or a good thing, depending on how you spin it. On one hand, early clinical exposure means that you have more time to hone your clinical acumen before interning. On the other hand, you can�t truly benefit from patient interaction until you actually have something constructive, enough baseline education to bring something productive to the table. A few of the students that we spoke with throughout the day laughed at the thought of interacting with patients �before they were truly ready.� �Hi, my name is ____, I�m a medical student, and I have literally no idea how to help you because I�ve been in school for just 9 months.� I think I can see both sides of the argument, and I also think that I would be happy in either system, as long as I was able to get some early patient interaction. And WashU starts you off with patient interaction in the first few months, with opportunities to begin volunteering at the student-run clinic within the first semester. So you get the best of both worlds, I think.<br/><br/>A final theme that wove its way through the day was the intangible �student happiness factor.� According to national surveys, WashU students are among the happiest in the country. According to the first year medical students, they have almost TOO much time for extra-curriculars. The traditional students indicated that their first year was almost easier than undergrad, with ample time to engage in extra-curricular pursuits, research, or personal lives.  Multiple students had gotten married while in medical school. These are happy kids.<br/><br/>There are many other selling points for WashU: the student body is intensely collaborative, despite the graded second, third, and fourth years.  The administration is constantly changing course structure and course leaders, in response to student feedback. The research opportunities are limitless, with plenty of dual-degree options, funded fellowships, and summer positions. Students match incredibly well; board scores are high; letters of recommendation come from experts in respective fields. The cost of living in St. Louis is extremely low, with some students spending 650 for a single apartment/suite.  The financial aid packages by WashU Med are liberal and generous; they really do want their students to succeed.<br/><br/>I can understand why some people are turned off by the traditional curriculum at WashU. But at the same time, I absolutely see its merits, and I see WashU as a system in which I could absolutely obtain maximum potential, and thrive as a well-rounded, happy, motivated, and productive student.<br/><br/>II Update: I'd really like to visit wash u, but NONE of the possible dates work for me... yet...<br/><br/>Secondary Received 6/29.</p>

					<b>Summary of Experience:</b>
					<p>Withdrew. Definitely a very difficult decision, but I don't regret it. I know Hopkins would have been a great place for me, but the scholarships, personal ties, and unique opportunities at my "Dream School" ultimately made me able to press the "send" button on my withdrawal email with a smile on my face. I'm so happy to finally have closure on the year. And I'm humbled and excited to see what the next few years bring.<br/><br/><b> Waitlisted via email on 12/12.</b> Bitterly disappointed, but nonetheless grateful for the opportunities I have been afforded so far.<br/><br/>Post-Interview Reaction (Mid-September):<br/>When I walked into my student host�s house, my jaw dropped. This was not a medical student�s house should look like� Nice furniture, art on the walls, clean floor, three stories, two patios, and to top it off, two incredibly kind and helpful medical students to answer all my questions. I really got along well with them, and with every student that I met. Even though this was THE Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the students were not robotic, hyper-productive machines of efficient excellence. They were genuinely friendly, funny, and intellectual people, who are also probably the future leaders of the medical field. That was the thing that struck me the most about JHSOM, I think. Even though these are the BEST and the BRIGHTEST students and faculty, they maintained a sense of humility and humanism that really appealed to me. <br/><br/>The next morning, I walked with one of the students to his morning class. Although apparently attendance drops during lectures (because all lectures are recorded and posted online), the small-group sessions are mandatory. I spent roughly an hour and a half listening to medical students chug through 5 case studies regarding Acute vs. Chronic Kidney Failure (including the various stages of progression of each disease). A little sidenote to those of you who, like me, are worried not just about getting into med school, but actually understanding the subjects: while I will not pretend I understood every detail of class, I actually felt that I was able to at least keep up with the material. <br/><br/>Even though I was 10 minutes early to the admissions office, I was the last interviewee to arrive. Everyone was so excited just to be there; everyone seemed to have left their egos at the door, and the humble energy was refreshing and endearing. Like I mentioned above, obviously everyone on that campus (including the interviewees) were bright individuals; but there was no �gunner spirit,� no �research egos,� and no �selfish studiers� (a term I�m trying to coin. Start using it. Let it catch on). The day began with an informal introduction from a dean of admissions. Next, we enjoyed a delicious catered lunch with medical students AND faculty members. The addition of faculty members to the generic �get to know students� lunch provided me with some insight into how well the faculty treat their students. Although I was initially worried that the faculty members might present themselves intimidatingly, I was pleasantly surprised to find them friendly, approachable, fascinating, and engaging. Next, we took a tour of the facilities�<br/><br/>If you�ve never seen Johns Hopkins and the affiliated hospitals, then I�m not sure I can totally explain just how/why it is so beautiful. The campus and the buildings are beautiful red brick monuments; the towers, the lawns, and the brick roads create a beautiful architectural and epoch dichotomy with the modernistic interiors. The student facilities are� everything that anyone could ask for. Study rooms? Check. Multiple lounges? Check. Brand new computers and smart boards? Check. Microphones in the lecture hall so you can ask questions IN A LOUDER VOICE??? Check. <br/><br/>After returning from the tour, we began interviews: one student, one faculty. The set=up was rather unique, as I�m sure some of you will know.  Us interviewees waited in a lounge, joined by 4-5 medical students. Who were also our interviewers. Every once in a while, they would pull one of us out of the general conversation to interview us more privately. It was strange, but definitely stress-free. The faculty interviewer was very difficult to read. But I went in, said my stuff, did my job, and left everything on the field I mean interview room. <br/><br/>And then the day was over. And when the dust settled, I could see that Baltimore and Johns Hopkins had cruelly taken my heart and were keeping it hostage. In all my anxiety over getting accepted/attending JH SOM, I have to remind myself that I was incredibly lucky just to interview here. I�d be even luckier to study here.<br/><br/>Just a few more notes about important things:<br/>Baltimore is, in my opinion, a perfect place to go to school. A city comprised of neighborhoods, each district has a distinct feel to it. Students rave about Baltimore, and I can see why. The hospitals are actually closer to �more dangerous� (and underprivileged) areas of town, which I wholeheartedly approve of. Put your hospitals closest to those who will need them the most, right? And allow your medical students to work in ERs that are only blocks away from violent neighborhoods. This isn�t to say that Baltimore is UNSAFE; any city will have bad and good neighborhoods. But my line of thinking is: live in a good neighborhood, serve the bad ones. <br/>The other thing I want to briefly comment on is the level of mentorship at JH SOM. Between faculty, advisors, and older students, every student has 3-4 personal mentors. Every student belongs to a smaller cohort of students (adorably called �molecules�) who meet to discuss life, school, stress, etc.  Clinical rotations during M3/M4 involve working with clinical faculty whose sole purpose on that day is to teach you to be a better clinician. That level of care and interest in student abilities is somewhat unparalleled. With that knowledge, I can start to really understand and believe what a residency admissions director once told me: �Johns Hopkins produces some of the most well-trained residents we�ve ever had. I have yet to be let down by them.�<br/><br/>II Update: Completely in shock. I'm so, so ecstatic.<br/><br/>Secondary Received 7/2.</p>

					<b>Summary of Experience:</b>
					<p>Withdrew following scholarships at other programs. <br/><br/><b> Waitlisted via email on 3/10.</b> <br/>Not overly broken up about this one. <br/><br/>Update/Interest Letter Sent in January<br/><br/></i>Post-Interview Reaction (Late September):<br/>I feel like I always start these things with some kind of comment (usually a complaint) about the transportation I used and/or the hotel I stayed with. I convince myself its because someone else can learn from my poor planning, but it�s equally (perhaps more) likely that I�m just a whiner. <br/><br/>Funny thing about living in the Midwest is that one loses their concept of East Coast geography. The states are smaller and inter-state transit is much more clearly established. When I was trying to pick an airport to fly into for this interview, I passed over the New Haven one because it was too expensive. That left me, in all of my narrow-mindedness with only one option: the airport in Hartford. It was completely inconceivable to me that it might be quicker/more reliable to use LaGuardia, in a different state, and use transit to get to New Haven. Using Hartford severely limited my flight options and transportation took way too long. I used the CTLimo service� never again. The drivers were extremely discourteous (not something I usually care about, but they were just so rough with my luggage, heavy handed, did not care where they dropped me off, etc). They made me wait an extra 1.5 hours at Hartford before coming to get me. After the driver picked me up, he left Hartford at a breakneck pace, only to turn around after 20 minutes to go BACK to the airport to pick up another passenger. It took me 3.5 hours to get to New Haven from Hartford, when the drive should really only take 45 minutes to an hour. Maybe that�s not such a big deal, but it was really late at night and I was feeling crabby.  The hotel I stayed at (Premier Suites) was pretty cheap, since I had the Yale affiliated discount. But I also found a spider the size of my fist in my room, so there�s that. In all honesty though, the hotel was totally fine for my purposes, I was just annoyed at my airport decision/CT Limo decision.<br/><br/>But on to the interview.<br/><br/>I think the first thing I noticed is that my fellow interviewees were great people. I had a lot of fun talking to everyone throughout the day, and I feel like I could connect with all of them (a sentiment that applies for the students and faculty as well). As a down-to-earth Midwesterner, I was a little worried encountering the ever-fabled �elitism� that you hear about with regards to some of these programs. While I didn�t encounter any of that, I do suppose that there was consistently more name-dropping throughout the day than at other schools. But perhaps that�s just a byproduct of having such a phenomenal faculty. <br/><br/>I really like the Yale System. There are elements of the system at many other schools, but Yale really goes all out. A true �no grading� system for pre-clinical, extremely high rate of �honors� during clerkships, classes end early to allow more time for independent interests, a faculty that encourages student initiative outside the classroom� these are all very appealing to me. I also tend to think that smaller class sizes foster collaboration to an extent that larger settings might not. I�m pleased to hear how many students take additional �fifth� years to flush out research projects or take additional clinical electives in preparation for competitive specialties; where another school might want to push people out the door, Yale is very welcoming of the approach. The Yale facilities were beautiful, and their legendary library (which definitely moonlights as a museum of medical history) lived up to the hype. <br/><br/>New Haven is.. New Haven. Pockets of wealth tucked away in a generally impoverished area. I might not want to live there forever, but that kind of atmosphere actually lends itself to a pretty diverse patient population. The hyper-functioning student-run clinic reflects the healthcare need in the area, which is definitely important in choosing hospitals to train in.<br/><br/>The interviews were extremely long, which didn�t bother me in the slightest. I believe mine were supposed to be 30 minutes long, each. The first one took 50 minutes, the second took 90. By the time I was done with the second one, all of the admissions faculty had taken off for the day.  There is some �word of mouth� wisdom running around about how �long interviews are bad, short interviews are good.� I suppose I�ll have another data point to contribute, come March. I really think the interviews went well; they were conversational, friendly, and engaging. And long.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed my day at Yale. Between a really exciting student body, a curriculum tailor-made for my learning style, tremendous faculty to learn from, and incredible hospitals to train in, I�d be completely thrilled to attend. Too bad they�re not on a rolling system. :(<br/> <br/>II Update: I don't quite believe it.<br/><br/>Secondary Received 7/8.</p>

					<b>Summary of Experience:</b>
					<p>Post-Interview Reaction (Early September): <br/>Even though the medical students� enthusiasm was a little overbearing at times, they all made one point crystal clear: the University of Michigan is �super-duper fun!� From the moment I walked into Pizza House the night before for a pre-interview dinner to the moment I left the Hospital, the students� cheeriness, smiles, and sheer merriment rained down upon me. If I had not taken the time to grill a few, I would have thought it all a bit fake � a ruse to make their first interview day more fun for all. But, after a few deeper conversations with M4�s, I came to realize that they truly love their experience in this program.<br/><br/>The interview day began with a speech from Dr. Gay, the Dean of Admissions. A powerful speaker, Dr. Gay emphasized the importance of community and collaboration in his efforts to show us the true �Michigan Spirit.� In his own words, students at the medical school are Michigan students, not Michigan Medical School Students. While this kind of campus/university-wide spirit might appear clich�, it is truly an accurate description of the atmosphere in Ann Arbor. In fact, as the interview day was devoid of the standard discussions about the curriculum, facilities, and financial aid, I felt as though the admissions officers wanted to sell us on Ann Arbor every bit as much as they wanted to sell us on the school itself. <br/><br/>The interviews went well; two long-form interviews with alumni and faculty members followed by six �short-form� interviews (which is really just a diluted, expedited MMI process). There was no point in the day at which I felt nervous, stressed, or disappointed in the way I presented myself (I wasn�t grilled). At the same time, I wasn�t as pleased with the interviews as I was with Pittsburgh (although I did get somewhat positive feedback from my interviewers).<br/><br/>All in all, I�m pleased with the way this interview went. I�m not as giddy with excitement as I was after UPitt (first interview). But I think that�s to be expected in some ways; I already know how tremendous this school is. I already know about the abundance of research opportunities and incredible local restaurants. I love this town, and I love this school. I nervously await October 15th...<br/><br/>II Update: Very pleased to be interviewing here. As a UMich undergrad, this school will <i> always </i> have a place in my heart.<br/><br/>Secondary Received 6/27.</p>

					<b>Summary of Experience:</b>
					<p>Post-Interview Reaction (Late August): <br/>From the moment I stepped off of the airplane, advertisements and banners extolling the University of Pittsburgh leapt out at me, as though they knew I was there to interview. The city is evidently quite proud of their health and educational systems, and I was about to find out why.<br/><br/>I�ll be completely honest; I applied to UPitt without a ton of previous knowledge about the school system, its mission, etc. I applied because it �sounded nice� and �would be a good school,� but without actually thoroughly educating myself on the program and promises. No matter: interview day quickly showed me how fantastic this school is, and how fortunate I would be to attend next fall.<br/><br/>I took the 28x bus to, and from, the PIT airport. $3.75 was too cheap to believe, and I genuinely enjoyed the ride into Pittsburgh (the skyline that emerges when you exit ~*the tunnel*~ is a beautiful sight). I stayed in a hotel the night before: the Hilton Garden Inn. To be honest, it was too expensive and classy for me: I felt far more comfortable checking out in a suit than I did checking in with shorts. Regardless, the room was comfortable, relaxing, and served me quite well.<br/><br/>The interview day began with an informal breakfast with the other interviewees. Although all were nervous at first, we quickly warmed up to each other, bonding over various interests and dislikes. Frankly, I was surprised at how much I genuinely liked the other people who interviewed with me, which leads me to a point I�ll expound on a little further on. After breakfast, a wonderfully informative and amiable tour guide led us through the Hospitals and Campus, pausing for a moment at the Anatomy Lab and Standardized Patient Practice Centers. I was thoroughly impressed by the facilities as well as the city. Pittsburgh is, believe it or not, a fantastic city � a bit bigger than Ann Arbor, but with all the collegiate culture and atmosphere. <br/><br/>After the standard curriculum overview and lunch with medical students, we proceeded to our two interviews: one with a medical student, and one with a faculty member. When UPitt says that their interview �isn�t meant to stress you out,� they mean it. That is not to say that I didn�t prepare well and focus on delivering eloquent, concise, yet interesting and elaborative answers, but rather that I never felt that someone was examining me with a fine-tooth comb, waiting for me to slip up so they could curse me out and reject me on the spot (a subject of many a nightmare for me). <br/><br/>The day concluded with a small group session, (you and the other interviewees discuss an ethical case, during which you are not being evaluated at all) financial aid presentation, and brief session with the Vice Dean of Student Affairs.  All were informative, interesting, and devoid of stress.<br/><br/>There are a few take-home messages about UPitt that I think are worth highlighting.<br/>1)	UPitt professes to be both a research institution, and an institution that highlights the importance of individualized, patient care. In other institutions, these aims may seem to contradict each other: the variability in individualized patient care gives rise to difficulties standardizing and validating treatment approaches. However, UPitt integrates a highly mentored scholarly project with early clinical exposure, in an attempt to force you to quickly realize your niche upon this continuum. I thoroughly believe that UPitt can provide me with an academic and clinical education that will serve me extremely well in my future career.<br/>2)	My faculty interviewer stressed the importance of taking initiative in your medical education. He said that UPitt has the most collaborative environments he�s ever experienced (which includes names like Wash U, Umich, and Baylor), and faculty are always happy to provide students with advice, mentorship, and opportunities to become more involved in research, shadowing, and global medicine opportunities. This is a huge, huge plus for me.<br/><br/>Finally, I want to return to the �important point� that I alluded to earlier.  Prior to today, I had thought of many potential ways to evaluate a medical school, none of which involved paying attention to who my fellow interviewees were. In hindsight, perhaps this is obvious to many people. Nevertheless, I was amazed at how friendly, intelligent, personable, and (quite frankly) fun my interviewees group was.  It speaks volumes about the kind of students that UPitt is interested in, which in turn echoes the program�s values. During future interviews, I will obviously look at how well I can connect with current students; but I will also pay very close attention to the ways in which I can connect with fellow interviewees. After all, many of them may be my future classmates.<br/><br/>II Update: First school to offer me an interview! Excited and nervous to begin this process...<br/><br/>Secondary Received 7/3.</p>

					<b>Summary of Experience:</b>
					<p>Post-Interview Reaction (Early September): <br/>I�d never been to New York City. I flew in over the bay, with the Statue of Liberty and the Chrysler Building in the distance, marveling at the city lights and spectacles. After getting settled with my student host, I went out exploring for an hour or so: my explicit goal was to find some good pizza, but implicitly I wanted to breathe in the city life. NYU is literally a stone�s throw away from the heart of Manhattan � that is, if you were to just drop the stone at your feet. I was enamored of the city life, so much so that I was concerned that the school would not live up to its location. My concerns were not confirmed.<br/><br/>The interview day started with an enthusiastic presentation about the university and its brand new curriculum. The presenter really sold the new system: earlier clinical exposure, more independence, more incorporation of didactic teaching and experiential learning. The novelty of the curriculum posed one concern for me: yes, it sounded great, but does it work? Are students actually learning more AND feeling happier? Well to the first question, the presenter reported the average class step 1 score from the class of 2016 (the first class under the new curriculum, I believe) 240. The average score from this class would be competitive for almost any residency application. As to the happiness factor? The students that I met with answered that for me. They were enthusiastic about their school, without being in-your-face about it. They were cheery without being overbearing. They were professionals who were very happy to be studying at this university. I was very impressed by everyone I met with.<br/><br/>The MMIs were manageable. As my student host wisely pointed out, there will always be a few stations that I wish I could re-do. But overall, the experience was positive. I won�t say much more, (program confidentiality and whatnot), but to anyone who is nervous about upcoming MMIs: don�t be. No one from my interview group was remotely flustered, and there�s no reason you will be either.<br/><br/>There are a couple more awesome things about NYU that are worth noting: 1) their simulated patient facilities are quite frankly the most beautiful and technologically advanced that I�ve ever heard of. 2) The 3-yr MD program is absurdly enticing (a current student really sold me on it). 3) The student housing options are incredible: for a relatively cheap price (compared to other options in Manhattan), you can live in a complex/dorm/apartment building five minutes away from class. 4) The connection Bellevue Hospital is unique in that Bellevue is quite literally world-famous for delivering world-class care. I could go on, but you get the picture.<br/><br/>The facilities? Beautiful and constantly being renovated and improved. The students? Engaging and easy to connect with. The faculty? Eager to help mentor students. The curriculum? Innovative and perfectly tailored to student concerns. Was there anything bad about this program?<br/><br/>Frankly, the answer is no. There isn�t anything that I remotely deterred me. I am very pleased to have interviewed here, and I hope to visit again.<br/><br/>II Update: Super pleased to receive, especially immediately after getting rejected by Mayo. <br/><br/>Secondary Received 7/1.</p>

					<b>Summary of Experience:</b>
					<p><b>+ Scholarship</b><br/><br/>Post-Interview Reaction (Early September): <br/>DukeMed. Where to even begin.<br/><br/>Since I�m going to spend most of this write-up raving about how much I loved my interview day here, I might as well start by slamming the hotel I stayed with. By saying something negative to start, perhaps you�ll take my positive comments even more seriously.<br/><br/>I stayed in the �Millenium Hotel Durham.� I chose it because it as a) close to Duke, b) offered �complimentary� shuttle service, and c) seemed like a pretty nice place. And I suppose the rooms were decent enough. But there was no wifi in any of the rooms; I had to go downstairs to the restaurant to get a signal. Then, so as not to take up valuable dinner space, I ordered a small reuben sandwich for a mere $20.00. Oh yea, and the shuttle from the airport (which I was lead to believe was free based on their website) actually cost $40.00. They billed it to my room. I wasn�t the only interviewee who stayed there, either; there were at least five of us who took the shuttle over to the medical school the next morning. I guess Millenium has an unjustified and undeserved monopoly on the �desperate interviewee seeking refuge close to medical school� market. <br/><br/>But on to the interview itself. The day began with a brief discussion with current medical students. They were energetic and informative, while maintaining a sense of mature professionalism (which students at other schools have lacked�.). Next, the MMIs. I don�t think anyone in my interview group truly disliked them; as I�ve said a few times now, they really are just a game. If you can put yourself in the right mindset (positive and resilient), there�s no reason to fear them. Then came lunch with more medical students. The girl who I ate lunch with was SO sincere in her passion for Duke; she excitedly endorsed the expedited curriculum, the mentorship, the pass/fail grading, the scholarly pursuit, the brand new facilities, and everything else that Duke has to offer. After a few more talks and a tour, the Dean dismissed us. For the sake of those who have yet to interview here, I will not spoil his speech. The only thing that I will say is that it was inspirational and motivating: more than once I felt tears coming to my eyes. Hands down the best moment I�ve had at an interview so far. I left the school feeling really pumped up. <br/><br/>I love the expedited curriculum; by cutting the fat off of a medical education, Duke manages to make time for much earlier clinical exposure and a full year dedicated to research. And they do this clearly without compromising their student�s knowledge base. Duke students score very highly on Step 1, and the match list for 2014 is hard to believe. Seriously, go look it up. 5 people matched to Neurosurgery in one year?  Countless others to Derm, Anesthesiology, EM, and other competitive specialties? Duke must be doing something very, very right. Students and faculty alike spoke about mentorship, both in the clinic and in the lab. Clearly those mentors have served their students exceptionally well.<br/><br/>The facilities are expensive and brand new. Duke sunk millions (maybe billions?) of dollars into new wards and laboratories; the Neurosurgery department is in a brand new space: windows everywhere, natural light, beautiful architecture, the works. Duke Academics appear to be using technology to its fullest advantage as well. The students use secure servers to share notes, videos, study guides, and engage in heated discussions over the material. The anatomy lab was the nicest I�ve seen so far. The (one) lecture hall I saw was pristine; even though the lectures are all recorded, I can�t imagine why you wouldn�t go to class just to take in that atmosphere. And as for the brand new laboratory facilities? Duke is clearly very proud of their research, and willing to dedicate extraordinary sums of money to attract phenomenal investigators. Between the research-centric philosophy at Duke and their top-notch labs, it�s obvious why only a few other medical programs can rival the work coming out of Duke.<br/><br/>All in all, Duke stole my heart today. An acceptance here would be a tremendous victory.<br/><br/>II Update: I'm really pleased to receive one, after the events that transpired 1 month ago. I'm also really happy that I scheduled the interview early in the season, but after my NYU interview (which also uses MMI format). I'll get good practice in, but still interview relatively early. Looking forward to visiting Durham!<br/><br/>(7/9) I was rejected less than 24 hours after submitting... While I knew it was entirely possible that I would be rejected without an interview offer, 24 hours seemed indicative of some kind of error. Sure enough, they "withdrew" their rejection, and my application once again says that it is ready for review. All of this happened without any email notifications; I just had to neurotically keep checking my application page. This is a phenomenal reality check after my early interview offer from UPitt.<br/><br/>(7/7): Should note that these secondary essays worried me more than any other school, so far. I'll be relieved to be offered an interview, just because it'll validate all the effort I put in. Worried about this app...<br/><br/>Secondary Received 7/1.</p>

					<b>Summary of Experience:</b>
					<p>Post-Interview Reaction (Mid-September):<br/>So here�s the thing. USC-Keck is a great medical school. Their research output is solid. Despite their status as a private institution, their commitment to serving the public at LA County Hospital embodies a greater ideal of service and community improvement. The experience that M3�s get at LA County is perhaps completely unique � where else in the country would you see this kind of patient population and disease diversity?<br/><br/>So why am I not completely thrilled after having two solid interviews here?<br/><br/>Before answering that question, I just want to provide a brief overview and review of my interview day. I showed up an hour early, because I had no idea what LA traffic would be like and, as is my nature, I overcompensated by being over-prepared. Go me. As I walked around the campus in my suit, willing my sweat glands to deactivate, I marveled at the radical difference between the university campus and the neighborhoods on either side. Without knowing any data regarding the safety and upkeep of the neighborhoods, I was making judgments based solely on appearance. And the appearances, at least, were dramatically different. I began to wonder where exactly students lived? Surely not here.. But how far, exactly, was the commute? <br/><br/>After checking in and receiving an informal, brief salutation (not presentation) from admissions faculty, I had my faculty interview. While there were a few hitches, especially when I was asked to explain why the ACA was having such a hard time getting through state governments (I�m not a politician, and I happen to be quite liberal, so I had to be delicate with how I answered that), the interview went well overall. Next came lunch with a few medical students: these girls were energetic, vivacious, and very pleased with their decision to go to USC. But I probed a little further; I�m starting to not take excitement or enthusiasm at face value as foolproof indices of a school�s worth. After several questions, the students seemed to really be excited about their classmates. About LA County. About LA. But research? Nah. The curriculum? Again, less pleased. And so I started to put together a clearer picture of USC. Finally, my student interview started off very formally; my interviewer was a no-nonsense M2, who flat-out told me that he expected to hear the good, bad, and ugly about me. After an uneasy start, we discovered that we both had longstanding, pre-existing, well-determined interests in Neurosurgery. And from there on out, the interview was a blast. More than anything, my interaction with him (a kind, compassionate, yet driven, competitive, intellectual student) compelled me further to USC. He mentioned something super important to me: at USC, M3�s see things that you can�t see anywhere else in the country. You get unique exposure and experience, which prepares you well for residencies.<br/><br/>In the end, I only have two qualms with USC. Their curriculum seems a little inflexible and didactic for the first two years; there was no mention of sim-patients, or unique classes. It�s a very standard two-year pre-clinical experience followed by boards. And I have to say, I�m very attracted to the 12/18-month pre-clinical curriculum. Second, I was a little confused by the attitude towards student research. A scholarly project is required here, but I kept hearing from students about how laid-back it was, about how �you can just review patient charts,� and about how �the hardest part is finding a mentor.� I really don�t want that to be my research experience. I want to produce research with some impact � research that really matters to someone, somewhere. This isn�t to say that USC students can�t/don�t churn out great projects! Just that I was a little bothered at the way that research, despite having a required scholarly project, appeared to be so casually dismissed as �just another requirement.� If it weren�t so well-known as a research institution, I wouldn�t have been bothered. But this is USC, and research should be a critical part of this medical education. Finally, I have no idea where I would live. And students didn�t really seem to have any suggestions. There don�t seem to be student apartments, like at many other places I�ve been to. Nor do there seem to be informal student neighborhoods. Everyone just seems to live everywhere. I guess that would be okay, but do I really WANT that?<br/><br/>I know that was a long paragraph about small things that bothered me. Do not, for any second, think that I disliked USC. USC would be an awesome place to go to school. It works so well for so many people, and perhaps I�ll be one of those people. I�d certainly like to have that option! I mean, this is one of the only places where you can rotate through a hospital like LA County. The students seemed so happy to be there. Perhaps I would be too. If I am lucky enough to have the chance, maybe a second look at the school, a second chance to meet faculty and experience the atmosphere would really convince me that this is the right place for me..  But for now, I am a little less �sold� on it.<br/><br/>II Update: Very excited to get this from a California school that I respect so much. Already nervous for my interview, and it's so far away (both temporally and spatially :P )<br/><br/>Secondary Received 7/10.</p>

					<b>Summary of Experience:</b>
					<p>Post-Interview Reaction (Mid-September): <br/>�Check to make sure that outlet works,� is what I wish I could have told myself 24 hours ago. <br/><br/>I stayed at the Glidden House: a beautiful (too expensive for my purposes, but within walking distance to the Medical School), if not slightly older building. My flight arrived at midnight, so I had roughly eight hours to get to my hotel, steal some sleep, wake back up, prepare, and walk to the interview. Or so I thought. When I plugged my phone charger into the wall, I did not check to make sure my phone was actually charging. It wasn�t. It died in the middle of the night, meaning that I overslept by a full hour. When I woke up at 7:56, approximately 20 minutes before I was supposed to be at the interview, I felt as though I were still dreaming. This had to be a nightmare. But it wasn't. I wanted to immediately call the admissions office, but my phone was dead. I had to wait 4-5 minutes until I could even call them to let them know I would be somewhat delayed. I opted to skip the shower in favor of splashing water on my face and hair, combing my hair as I pulled on my suit; I didn�t shave (I shaved yesterday anyways, and I don�t really have the ability to grow full, luscious facial hair); I chewed some gum instead of brushing my teeth. I flew downstairs with untied shoelaces, checked out of the hotel while tying my tie (one of my rare, few skills is that I can tie a tie without a mirror), and tried to call an Uber or a Taxi to take me the � miles to Case. No luck. I ended up walking at a breakneck pace to the school. The admissions office was TOUGH to find; I frantically used my phone to check addresses and campus maps, but my cell service was supremely poor (thanks a lot, Sprint). <br/><br/>Finally, I made it. I walked into the admissions office at 8:30, 35 minutes after waking up. My hair was combed, tie was on, belt was good� But I was late. Everyone had left the room already to go to the curriculum talk. I was lead to the room by a SUPER SWEET admissions office employee, but I still had to suffer through a few glares from other, more well-prepared interviewees. �I�m sorry,� I tried to tell them using my eyes. �I never do this, I�m always super well prepared. And I�m nice too! Please don�t hate me!� But that kind of set the tone for the rest of the day�<br/><br/>Except for the interviews. <br/><br/>I didn�t ask a ton of questions. I didn�t interact as much with my fellow interviewees as I normally do. So the social side of the interview day was pretty bad. But the interviews went really well. Everyone from Case Western was so happy to be there, so happy to be showing us their phenomenal school. By the end of the day, I felt much more comfortable. I was still a little sheepish around interviewees, but I was very pleased with everything else.<br/><br/>Case has a somewhat unique curriculum. Their blocks aren�t systems based, they�re elongated mixes of subjects that �make sense.� They have Essay Tests, rather than normal multiple choice exams. They do most of their learning in small group settings. It�s a unique curriculum, which certainly works well for some. I personally think I could thrive in their setting, but I would also probably prefer slightly more lectures. Their lectures, by the way, aren�t recorded. So you just have to come to class. But coming to class involves being at school from 8am to 12pm. No, I didn�t mistype that. They require their students to study on their own time, to actively learn with peers in the afternoons. But classes are 8am to 12pm. That�s it.  The faculty appeared to be very welcoming of student researchers, which is quite important to me. The clinical years offer a variety of opportunities for rotating. If you want to rotate at an institution known for academic and research excellence, Cleveland Clinic is down the street. If you want a more university/learning environment, the University Hospital is attached to the medical school. If you want to get down and dirty in a gritty ER that services less-privileged areas, the metro hospital is nearby. All in all, the clinical education is fantastic at Case, and if their preclinical style meshes with yours, it�s a perfect school.<br/><br/>There are a couple things worth noting about Case. Case is expensive, there�s no getting around it. Average student debt for 2014 Case Grads was 180,000, which is higher than the national average for other public schools. <br/>Case is also situated in Cleveland. Now, Cleveland is an interesting place to live. First off, it�s very cheap. There are some students paying 450/month for 4-person houses/duplexes. Secondly, there�s a lot to do in Cleveland that doesn�t meet the eye. Up and coming chefs are migrating to Cleveland to open restaurants; the art scene is impressive; the campus areas are totally gorgeous. But Cleveland is neither a Big City, nor a smaller town. It�s a combination of both, which I happen to like. <br/><br/>Despite the fiascos of the morning, I enjoyed my day here. Oversleeping didn't seem to affect my interviews at all, just a few minor social interactions (i.e. ugly looks from other interviewees). I look forward to hearing back from Case Western!<br/><br/>II Update: Interview Invitation! I love CWRU, and I really look forward to visiting their campus!<br/><br/>Secondary Received 7/16.</p>

					<b>Summary of Experience:</b>
					<p>Didn't receive the official letter until 8 days after status update!<br/><br/>Post-Interview Reaction (Mid-October):<br/>UCLA SOM surpassed expectations today. While I am apprehensive of Los Angeles, and the surrounding area, the Westwood Village and the Geffen Medical School took my breath away. I felt like I was on the set of a movie�  fitting.<br/><br/>I stayed in the Azul Inn, using only Uber service to travel between LAX, the hotel, and the school. I do recommend traveling to the school much earlier than the time indicated online: it took me a reasonably long time to find the admissions office � there weren�t any signs anywhere.<br/><br/>I had an afternoon interview time, so my day was perhaps a little different from others. My day started with a super informative tour from two eager M1s fresh off their first block in the curriculum. They showed us the library (not supremely beautiful, but beyond adequate), the anatomy labs (with gorgeous views), and the legendary Ronald Reagan Medical Center. They happily described the curriculum (block style, systems-based, pass/fail, unranked), the various rotation opportunities (the paragon: RRMC, but also at least two county hospitals for more bread and butter-type medicine), and the various extracurricular opportunities (literally anything you could want except maybe and ugly weather/snow enthusiasts club).<br/><br/>The MMIs were harder here than at a few of the other schools I�ve been to. I won�t go into much detail, except to say that I left the school feeling more disappointed in my performance than at any other school. Depressing, considering that this is my last interview for a long time (perhaps for good), and I really everything about the school.<br/><br/>My only worries about DG SOM are purely financial: being an out-of-state student living in Los Angeles at a Private medical school would not be gentle on my wallet. However, even there, DGSOM does everything they can to support students. With numerous merit-based scholarships and a stellar financial aid department, I am confident that everything would work out. <br/><br/>All in all, I�m really happy that I got to visit UCLA. I�m bummed that I didn�t beast their MMIs, but I guess I�ll just have to live with that. Hopefully they can look past a meek showing and grant me the chance to come back!<br/><br/>II Update: Thrilled to interview at <i>the</i> David Geffen SOM.<br/><br/>Secondary Received 7/24.</p>

					<b>Summary of Experience:</b>
					<p><b>+ Scholarship</b><br/><br/>Post-Interview Reaction (Early October):<br/>When all is said and done, the thing that I will remember most about Northwestern will be the tremendous relatability and enthusiasm of the student body. These students are here to excel, have fun, and make friends. They were more energetic and passionate than most other students at other schools I�ve interviewed at.<br/><br/>I flew in from St. Louis, and my flight was delayed by >2.5 hours. I showed up at my student host�s apartment later than expected, to find a conglomerate of M1s having a cocktail party. I was taken aback, totally bemused, and actually grateful for the chance to speak to medical students in a capacity so far removed from the admissions process. In fact, my student host had actually agreed to host another student; another SDNer, in fact. So that was totally cool.<br/><br/>The next day began early. 7:15am breakfast (dunkin donuts, score 1 for Northwestern) was followed by an hour-long orientation. During this time, we heard lots about �purple pride,� the progressive curriculum, and the wonders of living in Chicago. Then, interviews rolled around. As usual, each interview was supremely conversational, devoid of curveballs. Even the �panel� interview was very relaxed. After the interviews, we enjoyed lunch with some M1s, toured the campus (with the same M1s), and concluded the day with another short discussion of dual-degree programs and admissions timelines.<br/><br/>Here�s what I really liked about Northwestern. The students here were so� so proud to be attending this school. They had so much pride in their institution, but lacked any semblance of cockiness or arrogance. They were just really, really happy to be there. I can think of perhaps a dozen reasons for their happiness: the progressive curriculum (with genuine small-group learning comprising a massive part of the curriculum), tremendous match lists, the ambiance and vivaciousness of Chicago, the beautiful facilities (including unexpectedly nice apartments a few blocks from campus � more expensive than, say, St. Louis, but very nice for the price tag). You can�t really ask to rotate through better hospitals than Feinberg�s. Despite the private core institutions, NU makes sure to reach out into the community with free, student-run clinics. A plethora of student orgs, including a pretty competitive intramural soccer league. Should I keep going?<br/><br/>I loved Northwestern SOM, and I can barely wait to find out their decision.<br/><br/>II Update: Amazing gift from Northwestern; thank you for making my weekend. Can't wait to visit such a beautiful campus.<br/><br/>Secondary Received 7/25.</p>

			<h2 style="padding-top: 15px;">Summary of Application Experience</h2>

			<p></i><b>Mistakes I Made Along the Way:</b><br/>**I did not pre-write any secondary applications. Big mistake. When they come flying in every day, things get really stressful. Do yourself a favor and pre-write some school-specific answers while you're waiting for your AMCAS app to get verified.<br/>**My Non-Clinical volunteering experiences are pretty weak (at least since coming to college). It's not even for lack of trying, it's just very disorganized. Through various clubs and opportunities, I've tutored, visited hospices and retirement homes, cleaned up litter on the side of the road, etc. But it's all very sporadic. Rather than being focused on one specific non-clinical experience, I sort of haphazardly exposed myself to all of them (which in and of itself isn't a weakness). This strategy ends up looking pretty weak when you have to actually sit down and document hours on a secondary, although I suppose I have plenty to talk about in an interview (if I get one, knock on wood).<br/>** I ended up withdrawing from Wayne State & Colorado SOM pre-secondary submission (post-secondary invite) via email, because I just didn't get that <i> strong feeling </i> that I wanted to go there. Withdrawing via email is very scary, especially when you know that adcoms might talk to each other. I really hope that my email was polite and that their adcoms were gracious about it. I guess we won't know how it affected me until after the cycle is over. :/<br/>** I made my school list before I received my MCAT score. If you think my list looks kind of haphazard, that's because it is. It was formulated off of my own intuition about what my scores might have been, an intuition which was very bad and fluctuated dramatically depending on my mood. I wish I had taken the MCAT a little earlier, that way I could have cut out a few early on.<br/>** See Stanford University Description for <i>another</i> mistake I made...<br/><br/><b>Timeline:</b><br/>Started studying for MCAT over xmas break, though not very intensely. Didn't ramp up studying until early March. Took Kaplan course, and it provided me with great resources. Would recommend.<br/>May 8 - Took 12:00pm MCAT in neighboring city<br/>May 21 - Transcript(s) marked RECEIVED by AMCAS.<br/>June 3 - AMCAS Application Submitted at 3:12 PM ET.<br/>June 3 - UMich Career Center sent LORs to AMCAS at 3:40 PM ET<br/>June 4 - AMCAS marked LORs as received at 8:51 AM ET.<br/>June 10 - AMCAS marked Primary as complete at 9:37 AM ET<br/>June 10 - MCAT score received at roughly 3:00 PM ET :)<br/>June 11 - Verified AMCAS primary showed MCAT scores received<br/>June 27 - AMCAS Primary sent to schools.<br/>July 7 - First interview invitation (Pitt)<br/>July 21 - First rejection (UC-Irvine)<br/>July 29 - Marked Complete at All Schools<br/>August 26 - First Interview Attended (University of Pittsburgh, went well, loved the school, details under school)<br/>September Recap: 8 Interviews Attended this month<br/>October 15 - First Acceptances (3)<br/>October Recap: 4 Interviews Attended, 4 Acceptances this month<br/>November Recap: 1 Acceptance this month<br/>December Recap: 1 Waitlist this month<br/>January Recap: 2 Acceptances this month<br/>February Recap: 2 Acceptances this month<br/>March Recap: 1 Waitlist and 1 Rejection this month; I guess March has always been my least favorite month of the year :/<br/>April Recap: After receiving financial aid packages/scholarships and a few SLWs, I managed to make my final decision a whole 48 hours before the deadline! WHOOOOO *faints from exhaustion and existential crises*</p>
